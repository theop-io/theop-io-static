      "description": "This clip is just a small piece, of a much longer one-shot.  \"Nine Lives\" is made up of nine uncut Steadicam shots, ranging from 10-14 minutes each.  Dan Kneece and Henry Tirl worked together as the operators, often taking turns on the same shot.  \r\n\r\nThis is a long, wide tracking shot of the actors as they make their way through the graveyard.  Locations such as this are excellent places for camera movement.  The layout of multiple objects, headstones in this case, help to enhance the camera movement and enhance the 3D environment.  In the hands of a skilled Steadicam operator, the shots are very graceful."

Dan Kneece and Henry Tirl worked together as the operators, often taking turns on the same shot.  \r\n\r\nThis particular shot demonstrates a couple great whip pans, an extreme closeup and lock-off, along with a long boom down and up.\r\n\r\nIn shots as long as the ones in this movie, you can be pretty well assured that every skill in operating will be used at one point or another."

It is great operating under fast action."
