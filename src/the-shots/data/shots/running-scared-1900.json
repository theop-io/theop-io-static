After circling the boy, the camera flies straight up, ending up high above the set looking straight down.  Unlike in shots like <a href=\"http://www.steadishots.org/shots_detail.cfm?shotID=1\"><i>Kill Bill Vol. 1</i></a>, no wild walls or cranes were used in this shot.  Instead, the operator was simply harnessed to some cables that ran through a hole in the ceiling.  At the right moment, the cables were pulled and the operator, Steadicam and all, were hoisted up into position.",
