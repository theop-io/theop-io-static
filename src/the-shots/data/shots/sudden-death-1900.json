As an operator, thinking about what it would be like to do a shot like this, it almost makes you dizzy.  \r\n\r\nJerry used his Skyman invention to pull this one off.  A pulley system, attached to a truck outside the stadium lifted him from the ice, all the way through the roof.  It must've been a blast!"
