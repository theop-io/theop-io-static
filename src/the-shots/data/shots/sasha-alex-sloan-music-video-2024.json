      "operatorComments": "Matching the energy of the music can provide the biggest challenges, especially if the song is a ballad and much slower or subtle. Moving as slow as possible is very difficult on steadicam because you have a higher risk for lateral deviation to encroach on your framing. Showing footsteps breaks the immersion of the look that this music show has built, so really clean socket block control is the name of the game. The small vanishing line nature of the set with the lovely top soft boxes makes for framing opportunities that are sometimes not traditional, but really welcome if the music lends itself to that!",
