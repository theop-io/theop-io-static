      "description": "This shot begins with a very large decent from a crane.  It immediatly goes into the climbing of the stairs of the Capitol steps.  \r\n\r\nThere is an edit buried as we enter the building where the shot continues at a fast pace.  It includes a very rapid and interesting descent of a staircase and ends in an excellent lock-off.\r\n\r\nA quick eye will notice one of the Steadicam operator's tools of the trade.  As the camera descends the stairs inside the building, the ramp built to allow the operator to quickly descend the stairs is visible for a fraction of a second.",
