      "description": "Dailies of a partially deleted scene (the first half does appear in the final movie) covers a lot of ground, curb-stepoffs etc.",
      "operatorComments": "We had already planned to shoot the first half of this scene as a single shot and break up the second half, but during rehearsal we all sort of looked at each other and admitted that it played as one. While the shot itself is not nearly as interesting as the legendary McConkey/Burum/DePalma collaborations in design, I like that we watch Paul Giammatti's producer character attempt to hold on to his insecure belligerence only to be shut down twice.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot day in Monrovia, CA but we got the scene down before lunch, did a few pickups and called it a day ahead of schedule!\r\n\r\nThe shot appears in the deleted scenes of the film as an untimed workprint. It was determined that the \"business\" of the second half was too adult (aka boring!) for what was really a \"tween-age\" movie and thus only the first half was used in the film.",
