Dan Kneece and Henry Tirl worked together as the operators, often taking turns on the same shot.  \r\n\r\nThis is a long, wide tracking shot of the actors as they make their way through the graveyard.  Locations such as this are excellent places for camera movement.  The layout of multiple objects, headstones in this case, help to enhance the camera movement and enhance the 3D environment.  In the hands of a skilled Steadicam operator, the shots are very graceful.",
