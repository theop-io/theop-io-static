It's that age old feeling of knowing something the character doesn't and wanting to yell out a warning but can't.  \r\n\r\nIf you look closely, you will see the turnstile is missing, even though it makes a noise (thank you foley). Obviously, this was done specifically to allow the operator to move through behind the actor.",
