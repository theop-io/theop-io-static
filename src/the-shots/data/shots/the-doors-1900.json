      "description": "What a fantastic example of using the Steadicam to enhance the emotion of the scene.  The pronounced, slow, disorienting use of dutch and odd angles throughout this shot help engage the viewer in the noisy, drug riddled experience that was Jim Morrison at a high class party.  Further enhancing the feeling is a great use of different frame rates to play with the perception of time."
