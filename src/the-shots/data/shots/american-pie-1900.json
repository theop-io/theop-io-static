      "description": "This is a great shot in regards to composition.  In the one shot, the Steadicam is used to setup what would otherwise be several traditional ones: a two-shot tracking, a medium two-shot, a single OTS closeup, and a single clean closeup.  Garrett Brown often says his favorite part of Steadicam shots is not when the camera moves, but when it starts and stops.  This shot is an excellent example of perfect execution of starting and stopping in the necessary composition."
