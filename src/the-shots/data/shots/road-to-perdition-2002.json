      "description": "A great shot, combining many challenging elements.  We start above, looking down as Hanks steps off the elevator.  We begin to track Hanks from above, and then slowly begin to drop down to eye level.  The tracking continues into the hotel room where the assassination takes place.  We end on a very clever way to show what has happened in the other room, without moving the camera.",
