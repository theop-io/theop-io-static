      "description": "This is a great example of how quickly a collision can occur.  It's scary how similar it is to an automobile accident.  Fortunately, in this case, everyone walked away unharmed.",
      "operatorComments": "Ah, yes, my favorite blooper...\r\nThis Cuban dance group were in town for The Columbia Festival of the Arts, and we'd been hired to do a promo video. These shots were done the morning after the live performance, to be cut into the live show in post. We had very little time, so they were doing their numbers and I flew around them. In this case i zigged when I should have zagged, and bonked one of the gals in the head with the camera. If you step through the movie you can see her ear pressed up against the lens in one of the frames. \r\nFortunately, no one was hurt, and we avoided an international incident."
