      "description": "This episode of \"Third Watch\" features uncut takes for all of its primary acts.  The operator, Mike O'Shea, was given the liberty of 45 minute breaks between takes.  That amount of time between takes would normally be unacceptable, but considering the crew needed to reset for a shots that were 9 straight minutes, there was obviously a lot of work to be done.  As well, the more rest given to the operator, the better his performance would be for each take.",
