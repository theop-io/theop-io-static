      "description": "What would be a relatively simple walk-and-talk is complicated by a few big factors.  The first being the use of anamorphic lenses, which will alert any deviation from horizontal very quickly.  The second being a rather large difference in height between the actors.  The sweet spot for a nice frame is much smaller than would be for two actors of similar height.  The third factor is the escalator.  traveling backwards and down, tilting up and holding a solid frame for the entire ride.  Very well done.\r\n\r\nTwo other key points to note: see how the transition from a wide shot to a medium is hidden as they turn to head down the escalator.  The shot ends with a long, solid lock-off.",
      "operatorComments": "Director John Badham is a great guy, and a pleasure to work with. As the shoot progressed, I was called upon to deliver more and more tricky handheld and steadicam shots, along with the usual B-Camera duties throughout the 4 month shoot. Michael J. Fox and I are the same age, and we were both recently married just before the Hard Way. Of course he earned 6 million dollars from Universal, far more than my steadicam rental!"
