      "description": "A game of \"follow the tray\" becomes a very slow rotation around the speaker, eventually going down on one knee for the final closeup.\r\n\r\nPapert has earned a reputation for amazing slow moving shots.  Operating a Steadicam at a slow pace is much more difficult than at a fast one.  Eliminating the smallest of wobbles that exist in virtually all Steadicam shots is a skill requiring a great dedication to the craft.",
      "operatorComments": "One of the tried-and-true gimmicks for a shot at a bar or a party is to follow the tray of drinks to a character. This one had a nice spin on it in that we rediscover the tray halfway through. There are a lot of choices to be made by the focus puller in a shot like this; when do you shift attention to the background or foreground? I think he did a great job.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, one of those women is not a woman.",
