      "description": "A very interesting tracking shot around the laboratory.  Shot on a very wide lens, the background distorts as the camera moves, creating a unique feeling.  At the end of the shot, the camera becomes part of the special effects, taking on almost the POV of the electricity as it jumps from conductor to conductor."
