      "description": "A great oner, incorporating our good old friend - the elevator.  The most difficult element to shooting in working elevators, aside from the limited space, is the start and stop.  When the elevator begins, the Steadicam wants to do its job and stay put.  When it stops, it wants to keep going.  Dangremond does a great job in this shot of actually fighting the function of the Steadicam for those two brief moments.  Not allowing much, if any, movement to be introduced into the shot by the elevator.\r\n\r\nIn McConkey's shot from \"<a href=\"shots_detail.cfm?shotID=12\">Bonfire</a>\", the sound crew rode up in the elevator next to the camera, allowing them to maintain radio connection with the mics.  This shot appears to be completely ADR, and understandably so.",
