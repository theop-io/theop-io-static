      "description": "A great shot, thanks most to the second half of it.  After the actress has split from the actor, and the camera makes its turn, the frame that is held is perfectly symmetrical.  This symmetry is held consistently as the camera pushes through the doorway at the back of the boat.\r\n\r\nWe don't notice this framing until the actress takes one final glance over her shoulder, before heading toward the back of the boat.  This may very well have been intentional by the actress and filmmakers as a subtle device to break up the shot making it almost appear as two shots."

      "description": "Shots traveling from exterior to interior (and vice versa) are always very visually interesting.  The final 20 seconds of this shot, as the actors take a seat at the table is great as the camera movement slows into an extremely smooth and delicate arc, booming down as the actors take their seat."
