      "description": "This is the final shot of the film.  There are few operators that are real masters of the long shot.  Shuttleworth, also having done Boogie Nights, is one of those masters.  Your eyes always have something to look at.  There is never any dead space in the frame.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not entirely a product of the operator's skill.  It requires a great collaboration between operator, director, DP, and a few other keys to plan a shot such as this.  It takes the coordination of the entire crew to execute it."
