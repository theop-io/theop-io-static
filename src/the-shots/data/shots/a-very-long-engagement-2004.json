      "description": "Excellent shot.  Beginning with an amazingly slow and steady descent on a crane, moving into an incredibly smooth step-off, the shot winds through the marketplace, seeking out the actors.  \r\n\r\nThis shot required some incredible choreography, obviously.  One great moment is as the actress stops to ask one of the vendors a question, there is a rock solid lock-off.  The addition of the action of the lettuce tossing in the immediate foreground is one of those elements that made an ordinary lock-off, extraordinary.",

We get coverage of the actor running through the field from all angles: high, low, leading, following, closeup, wide, and more.  The final push into the closeup at the very end lands in a rock solid stop and lock-off.",
