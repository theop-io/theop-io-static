      "description": "Incredible descent of a flight of stairs.  Absolutely no wiggle in the frame, and the actor remains framed perfectly.  Often, it is not the stairs themselves that are the difficult part, but the first and last steps that pose the most problem.  In this case, the move is perfectly fluid.  The horizon is held at the end, even through the long pan.  It's a good example of the importance of dynamic balance."
