      "description": "This is a very popular shot among Steadicam Ops.  Muro begins the shot, from an elevated view attached to a zip line.  As the actors race down the path towards the fire, the zip line begins to follow, traveling down the hill to the bottom.  Without pause, Muro detaches from the zip line and continues to chase Denzel through the jungle at a near run.  Although there is a cut towards the end, both shots flow together nicely and are executed amazingly.\n\nSimilar to the other shot from Mighty Quinn, there had to be communication between operator and actor here.  As Denzel reaches the end of the path, he can see that Muro has not yet reached the bottom of the zip line.  To allow Muro time to descend, Denzel stalls by backtracking to check out one of the extras."
