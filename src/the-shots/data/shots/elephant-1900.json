      "description": "This shot, amazingly, begins with an almost 2 minute static hold that is so solid, it can easily be mistaken for a tripod.\r\n\r\nAs one of the characters leaves frame, the camera follows, and begins a long tracking shot throughout the school grounds -- one of many in this film.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a shot like this can only really be appreciated when seen in the context of the entire movie, however, this shot does incorporate several individual impressive elements.\r\n\r\nThe focus pulling, iris pulling, and speed ramping all illustrate how much of a team effort the Steadicam truly is."
