I had decide to put my Steadicam on a dolly called \"baby-boule\" (see equipment). The key-grip was very good, the stuntmen too. I think we did 3 takes....one of my best souvenir on this film...",

      "description": "This shot begins with some great low mode running through a train terminal.  It cuts outside where the tracking of the subjects continues using a couple very nice low mode shots vehicle mounted.   The shot then cuts to a great crane descent into a close-up.",

The camera was an ARRI 535 B. For me it was the only good way to make the shot and everyone was very happy with it."
