      "operatorComments": "J-P Jeunet wanted a very low-mode shot. The shot was fast and difficult to synchronize with the actors and the stuntmen. I had decide to put my Steadicam on a dolly called \"baby-boule\" (see equipment). The key-grip was very good, the stuntmen too. I think we did 3 takes....one of my best souvenir on this film...",

      "description": "This shot begins with some great low mode running through a train terminal.  It cuts outside where the tracking of the subjects continues using a couple very nice low mode shots vehicle mounted.   The shot then cuts to a great crane descent into a close-up.",
