      "description": "The opening shot of the movie.  It involves a tilt, combined with the dropping of a crane, allowing the operator to step off at the bottom.  We then proceed to reveal the characters attending a church service.  The operating is very slow, controlled and precise.  The crane step-off is nicely hidden inside a slight pan."

      "description": "A rather long shot, revealing many of the characters, as well as doing an excellent job of establishing the location.  Well timed tilts allow us to see the size of the setting.  Most notable about this shot is the work on the staircase, which maintains headroom extremely well.  Note that the actors stop for a moment on the landing, allowing the operator to catch up, and pass them, changing the perspective for the second half of the shot.  A great way to add variety and interest into a one-shot."
