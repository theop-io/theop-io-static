It was just too critical of a shot.."

      "description": "Another promo, shot music video style.  Much of the video is shot in low-mode, which seems to echo the laid back and \"low\" Los Angeles, hip-hop feeling.",
      "operatorComments": "This aired during the Results show of American Idol 2006. 3 contestants remain: Tylor Hicks, Katherine McPhee and Elliot Yamin 85-90% Steadicam. \r\n\r\nThis was shot at the Sea Port Marina and Hotel in Long Beach. Lots and lots of low-mode. Tethered to a video cable.  I flew the rig and camera up-side-down. They flipped the image in post. Transition time to go into low mode or high mode was around 15 seconds or so."
