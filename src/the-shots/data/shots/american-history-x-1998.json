      "operatorComments": "The toughest stairs shot I ever tackled. It starts in missionary pushing towards Ed Norton (not included in the final cut), then I turn right to precede him down the stairs while panning left into Don Juan. I navigate the landing, avoid a light in the corner, and continue under an amazingly low header--watch a few seconds later as Ed ducks his head under it--and hit the brakes as Ed pauses on the landing. When he starts up again, I hit the ground floor and pan him right as my body counter-rotates back into missionary, then I follow him to the door. We did dozens and dozens of takes with different focal lengths. Powerful scene!",
