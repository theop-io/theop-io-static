      "description": "This is a very fun little shot, though not simple in any way.  Done in low mode, at a relatively quick pace, this shot displays the great importance of good dynamic balance.  With the fast paced pans and turns around the set, if the sled had not been balanced properly, it would have rolled very dramatically with each turn."
