      "description": "Garrett Brown has said his favorite thing about camera motion is the moment when the camera starts and stops.  Finding those moments requires a very keen eye, and an operator that is very in touch with the action of the scene.  In this shot, especially the last few seconds, Muro demonstrates this very well as the camera sneaks along with the actress."
