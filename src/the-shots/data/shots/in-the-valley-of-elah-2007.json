      "description": "Watch this shot a few times.  Notice how the operator seems to be thinking one step ahead of the action at all times.  Starting with a crane step-off, this shot is not terribly long, but contains a number of very specific cues, each one of which the operator lines up and hits every time.  A very interesting cue to observe is as the actress rounds the police car, she is frame left with the paramedics previewed in the background, frame right.  In an instant, the camera moves around, setting the paramedics as the focus of the frame having swapped sides with the actress.  A similar \"frame-swap\" happens a moment earlier with the fellow in the police car.",
