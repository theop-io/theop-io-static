      "description": "Unlike a typical roundy-round, this shot circles to some extent, but breaks out of it at key points to hit on important actions in the scene.  Note the adjustments for headroom throughout the shot, depending on the height of the featured subject.  This maintains good composition in every frame."

      "description": "This is a great shot that alternates composition between a standing subject and one that is seated on the floor.  Obviously a great difference in height, this shot demonstrates a great use of booming and tilting to compensate for the differences in height."
