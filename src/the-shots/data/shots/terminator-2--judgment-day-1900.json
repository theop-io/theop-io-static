      "description": "This is a very short shot of a child's RC Truck zooming through the house.  It is interesting to watch due to the fact that it is so low to the ground.  More interesting, is the fact that it is shooting a non-living object.  Experienced operators will begin to develop a sense of how people move.  This allows them to anticipate, and be ready to capture the necessary framing.  However, a non-living object such as this, has very random movements, making the anticipation of them much more difficult."
