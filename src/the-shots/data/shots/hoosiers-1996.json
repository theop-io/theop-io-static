As soon as the gym door is opened, the noise, commotion and camera movement all kick in immediately elevating the emotion of the scene.",

      "description": "Some of this sequence's best moments are when the camera stops.  Excellent composition when the ref and Hackman are arguing, with Dennis Hopper framed perfectly in the background.  Another great moment is the final frame as the camera settles in the huddle on the sideline.  Those final seconds of the sequence, the camera really takes on the role of one of the players on the court.",
