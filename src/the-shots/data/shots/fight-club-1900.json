      "description": "This is a very famous Steadicam shot.  We lead the actors down the sidewalk.  When they stop, they board a bus and stay with them as they travel down the road.  This shot demonstrates great skill in navigating through such a restrictive place as a city bus.  It takes perfect knowledge of the size and shape of your equipment and the objects around you."
