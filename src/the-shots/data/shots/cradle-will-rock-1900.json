Shots like this are where mastery of the basics, and then the ability to recall them all involuntarily the instant they are needed truly pays off."

      "description": "A shot like this is loved by both actors and operators.  For the operator, it is a fun shot to set up, rehearse and shoot.  The actors also like it because they can perform the full scene without the need to stop for different camera angles.  \r\n\r\nOne thing to note is towards the end of the shot when the actor sits down in the chair.  The camera boom down is timed perfectly, maintaining excellent headroom, hiding such a drastic change in height.",
