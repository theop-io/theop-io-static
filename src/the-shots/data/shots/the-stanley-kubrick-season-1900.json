      "description": "One of the biggest compliments in this business is to have your work parodied - especially on such a detailed level.  Channel 4 featured much of the same equipment that was used in the filming of \"The Shining\".  Many of the props were recreated from footage and pictures.  The spot was shot on a Cooke 25mm lens - one of Kubrick's favorites."
