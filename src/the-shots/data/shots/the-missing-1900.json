      "description": "This shot is a nice walk-and-talk between two of our characters.  The unique thing about it, however, is that we don't stay locked on the characters with the dialog the entire time.  We drift off, observing a few of the key events taking place in this street.  It is said that this movie is told, in a way, from the POV of the little daughter.  This shot illustrates that point very well.",
