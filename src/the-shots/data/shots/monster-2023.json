      "operatorComments": "Oner on 35mm film, featuring 3 separate crane step on/offs throughout the sequence. We used a Chapman Supernova Crane base to move the Titan platform crane. Managing the complexity while still building an engaging shot was the biggest challenge for a shot like this. All of the parts came together to make something special that everyone on the crew was proud of!",
