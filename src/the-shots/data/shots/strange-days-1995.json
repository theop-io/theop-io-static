      "description": "This is an amazing shot.  It was executed using a completely custom built 35mm camera weighing only 8lbs.  That was mounted atop a modified Steadicam which gave it a more human-like POV feel, rather than an objective camera feel.  There are a few edits hidden amongst the fast pans since production was not able to find one location that had everything they needed.  The edits are hidden very well and the overall effect is incredibly convincing.\r\n\r\nThese POV sequences are what Strange Days is based on.  There are a number of them throughout the film.  This setup was designed specifically for them.",
