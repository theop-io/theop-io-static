      "description": "A great use of Steadicam as a third-person observer of the scene.  The operating down the large flight of stairs is excellent, even with a couple changes in composition.  Amazing control is demonstrated toward the end as the camera circles around the captain sitting in the chair.  Most likely, this was shot in \"low-high\" mode, which is often an awkward position to hold."
