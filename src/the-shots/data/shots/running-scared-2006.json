      "description": "What starts out as a relatively routine Steadicam shot, ends up in an incredibly unique way.  After circling the boy, the camera flies straight up, ending up high above the set looking straight down.  Unlike in shots like <a href=\"http://www.steadishots.org/shots_detail.cfm?shotID=1\"><i>Kill Bill Vol. 1</i></a>, no wild walls or cranes were used in this shot.  Instead, the operator was simply harnessed to some cables that ran through a hole in the ceiling.  At the right moment, the cables were pulled and the operator, Steadicam and all, were hoisted up into position.",
