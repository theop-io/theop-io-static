      "operatorComments": "Fun stuff.  I think Tony was a bit more nervous than I was.  Of all the days you want your parents to watch TV, mine were on a  plane coming back from England.  Such is life.  I sent them a tape.  I had thought of spinning the rig 360 after I came out onstage but chickened out at the last minute.  Regretted it ever since.  Julliana Marguilies is sitting in the front row and you can hear her scream my name when Tony introduced me which I thought was cool.  Rich Davis came by set to do the behind the scenes stuff and did some great work.  Fun to have him flying around following me flying around.  Why was my hair blonde?",
