      "description": "This is a small leading shot.  The shot starts out in a lock-off, boomed low as the actor is seated.  The lock-off is executed with great stability, and could easily be mistaken for tripod if it did not begin to move.  Consistent headroom is kept while the actor stands, as well as when he climbs a small flight of stairs.",
