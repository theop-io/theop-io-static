      "description": "There are two interesting elements in this shot.  When the actor first steps out of the building, virtually the entire frame is within a reasonable focus.  As the actor takes his moment for thought, the camera moves close enough to allow for everything but the actor to fall completely out of focus.  This helps to bring the audience right into the thoughts of the character.\r\n\r\nAs the actor re-enters the building, the movement around the woman is extremely smooth and consistent, landing in an excellent lock-off to frame the two of them.",
