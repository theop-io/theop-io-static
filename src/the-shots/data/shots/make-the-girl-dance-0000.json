      "description": "The speed combined with the distance the operator moves backward on this shot is remarkable.  If the operator was able to get his or her way, hopefully there was a vehicle, rickshaw, dolly, segway, or something they were able to step on at the beginning in order to finish the shot.  If not, in order to maintain a shot at this speed for this long traveling backward, would be a feat of physical endurance few of us would want to sign up for.  ....perhaps there was some other incentive.....\r\nThis video gained so much notoriety, it inspired a number of spoofs, including [this amusing commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uDrFEXcg_A&feature=channel) for Guitar Hero.",
