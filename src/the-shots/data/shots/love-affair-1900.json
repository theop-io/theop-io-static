      "description": "Opening shots are always very important in establishing the feeling of the movie to come.  This shot is nice, fast paced, and executed very well despite moving backwards rapidly.  The most difficult lock-offs to do are those that end after a pan.  This one demonstrates a solid lock-off coming out of a pan."
