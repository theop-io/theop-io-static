      "description": "One of the most gutsy Steadicam moves ever caught on tape.  The operator, mounted on a Segway, speeds down the aisle at a sprinter's pace.  Upon reaching a small ramp at the edge of the stage, he dismounts and continues the shot on foot without slowing down.  The live to broadcast version can be viewed <a href=\"shots_detail.cfm?shotID=302\">here</a>."

The specific shot in question can be seen at 2:35 into the clip.  With this, we can see that not only is the operator focusing on the step off, not falling, and general framing. He is also performing dutch tilts and zooms during the shot as well.  Very, very impressive."
