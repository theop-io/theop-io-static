The operator's framing is held so well, the abrupt elevation changes when the actor and operator step down each step is well hidden.  It is hardly noticeable they are decending a staircase.",

      "description": "This is a quick shot, however a good demonstration of pace changes.  The actor goes from a normal walk, to a fast walk, to a near run, and then turns around and goes in the opposite direction for a moment.  The Steadicam must be second nature in a shot like this, since 100% of the operator's focus must be on the composition.",
