      "description": "This shot follows our actor into and out of his classroom.  There are two points to note in this shot.  The first being, we don't see a lot of tracking shots of children.  For that reason, the shot is interestingly unique.  When the shot cuts from leading to a slow push down the hall after our actor, the operating is excellent.  Slow, controlled and gentile: again a quality that seems simple but is one of the most difficult to master.",
