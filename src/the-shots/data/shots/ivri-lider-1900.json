      "description": "A very nice one-shot music video.  The concept of the video was a reflection of the actor/singer's childhood memories.  Shot at 48fps, the slow motion helps to convey the feeling of stopped time.  The operating is extremely smooth and meticulous in this shot.  Assias served as both DP and Operator on the shoot."
