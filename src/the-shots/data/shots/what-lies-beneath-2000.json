      "description": "The shot itself is relatively simple.  It is slow and consistent in its movement.  The coordination of the crew is what is truly amazing in this shot.  We leave the bathroom with the character; tub empty, bathroom clean and dry.  We enter the bedroom, and then the hall which contains an alternate door to the bathroom.  In under 60 seconds, the crew had completely changed the dressing of the bathroom.  Not only is it now completely fogged up, but the bathtub is full of water - still water, to be exact.  A couple of CG effects help to sell the ghost's presence.  The foley department did a great job in post of recreating the natural sounds since the noises the crew made in the background had to be cut out.",

      "description": "This shot starts out quickly, then slows way down as the two characters interact.  The camera slowly moves from one character to the other, much like a common cross-cut conversation would take place.  However, there are no cuts.  The camera remains invisible while heightening the emotion of the scene.",
