      "description": "Shots like this are great.  This one starts very small and intimate.  Soon, we step outside the dressing room and enter the arena, surrounded by thousands of people.  The shot finishes on a crane, rising up above the ring.\r\n\r\nOne of the best elements to this shot is the way in which the operator navigates the stairs.  Always one of the most difficult things for an operator to do, this shot takes us both backwards and forwards traveling up flights of stairs."
