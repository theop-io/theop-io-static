      "description": "'The Small Monty' was a test shot for a feature, using a tight, slow frame and a subtle jib to begin, then switching into Don-juan to get down a flight of stairs and finnally ending in a wide tracking shot. Suspense was the main feeling we were trying to convey.\r\n\r\nKit used:  Fully build RED 1, RED Pro prime 25mm, F4, Bartec Follow focus all rigged on my Actioncam Rebel pro",
      "operatorComments": "As a fairly new op (1 year), it's all about trying to do everything, and everything well.\r\n\r\nFor me, I am pleased with the shot, the staircase is smooth, switching into it was nice, switching out at the bottom was a little tricky and there is a slight hicup on the horizons.\r\n\r\nThe performance from the actor were quick than slow and quite jagged as he was in 'pain'- this proved tough to keep him central in frame while keeping the shot smooth, so I planned a route that i would stick to and pan to adapt/keep him in frame.\r\n\r\nWatch this space!\r\n\r\nBest of luck to all Steadi newbies.\r\n\r\nDoug Walshe",
