      "operatorComments": "This was a very interesting shot as we had been using a Panaglide on this film, but due to a scheduling mixup we weren't able to get one for this day which forced us to use the Gold Panaflex with full studio matte box and my Steadicam Model II. Very heavy I must say. There is quite a lot of Steadicam in Wild At Heart including the famous scene in the now extinct Palamino night club where Nicolas Cage says, \"This is a Snake Skin jacket. It's a symbol of my indiviuality and personal freedom.\" All in all a great film and a wonderful experience.",
