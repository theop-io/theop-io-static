      "description": "This is the primary opening sequence of the film.  The full opening sequence continues for almost 13 minutes.  Within that time, there are 8 well hidden cuts, mostly in either whip pans or something crossing full frame.\r\n\r\nThe shot here is the first 7 minutes of the opening sequence.  This is the part of the sequence containing most of the excellent Steadicam work by McConkey.  \r\n\r\nThis shot, and the sequence as a whole, are excellent examples of a director's vision, and understanding of the tool.  Add to that vision, a great amount of trust and collaborative respect for an operator, and you get a shot that people talk about for years to come.",
