The shot perfectly illustrates, in real time, the efficiency of the assassins as they carry out their task.  By letting the scene and action play out, the audience is fully engaged with the action in its most raw form.  No quick edits, intense closeups, or frantic camera movement to exaggerate the feel of the scene.",
