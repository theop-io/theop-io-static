      "operatorComments": " A Music video consisting of the same blocking repeated 3 times with some changes between each 1 minute shot. The scene informed the camera movement to be lively and locked onto the actors, movement that was as motivated as possible. The performance was blocked by choreographer Amy Gardner. The Start and end frames needed to be as close together as possible for the post stitch to work. Some Rotoscoped animation helped smooth out any deviation.",

      "description": "Cool concept of the same thing over and over with a few differences. Some great animation as well which you usually dont get in steadicam shots.",
