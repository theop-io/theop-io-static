      "description": "Although not much distance is covered in this shot, the camera serves as the POV of the \"man on the street\".  The shot itself is extremely smooth despite the slow movement.  Combined with great tilts up to each of the speakers, it's a non-traditional, but very engaging use of the Steadicam.",
