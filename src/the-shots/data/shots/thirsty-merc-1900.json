      "description": "Music video consisting of three Steadicam shots, and one green screen.  The first shot is impressive - taking the singer out of the house, down stairs, and outdoors to continue walking at a rather brisk pace, leading the entire time.  The shot of the full band has moments of excellent slow, smooth movement - something that's perhaps more difficult than even the stairs."
