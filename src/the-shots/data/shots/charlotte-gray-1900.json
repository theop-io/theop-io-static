      "description": "Source: Paul Edwards's Website\r\n\r\nThis clip is a selection of two scenes from the film. The first scene is in an aircraft hanger as Cate Blanchetteâ€™s character is being prepared for her mission to France. The second scene is a little unusual, as it uses the Steadicam to help to add the illusion of flight in the interior of a stationary plane. It starts with the camera upside down; we then rotate 180 degrees, while pulling back to reveal the inside of a Dakota plane with our heroes strapped in.",
