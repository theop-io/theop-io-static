      "description": "One of the rare times the operator could argue for an acting credit in a film... Garrett and the Steadicam assume the mind and eyes of the wolf as it stalks its prey.  Great use of the elements in the park to maneuver around, heightening the tension of the scene.  I'm very curious to know what faces Garrett might have been making while shooting."
