It is a technique that is very subtle, but very effective.  Pay attention to the corners of each wall.  Garrett will hang on them for as long as possible without losing the actors.  This adds a great element of suspense to the walk.",

About this shot, Garrett will remark it's one of the first times he learned the importance of being able to land for a lock-off in a comfortable posture.  Although 20 seconds might not seem like a long time, if it is take 30, and you're wearing 70+ lbs of gear, and find yourself in an uncomfortable position for a lock-off, that 20 seconds will seem very long.",
