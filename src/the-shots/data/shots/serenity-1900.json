      "description": "An excellent single shot in a movie that, unfortunately did not get a lot of attention.  This opening sequence is fantastic.  The set is a large part of a spacecraft and the camera goes all through it - upstairs, down corridors, through doorways and more.  \r\n\r\nIf you watch closely, slight zooms are used to close and retreat larger distances without forcing the camera operator to break into a run, or crowd the actors, or backpedal quickly."
