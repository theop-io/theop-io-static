Pans, tilts, walk-and-talk, closeups, wides, dutch, and more are all in this one continuous shot.  Even better, none of the movement seems gratuitous.  It is all going right along with the action.  There is far too much to describe with words.  Just watch and enjoy - especially the final frame.\r\n\r\nWatch a great commentary of this shot, by Larry, <a href=\"shots_detail.cfm?shotID=304\">here</a>."

Suddenly you see in order to make such a shot look effortless, a tremendous amount of thought and preparation must come first.... and also a legendary operator."
