      "operatorComments": "The toughest stairs shot I've done to date (hopefully a record never to be unseated)! It starts in Missionary pushing at Ed Norton, then I turn right to precede him down the stairs while panning left into Don Juan. I hit the landing (avoiding a light in the corner) and continue under an amazing low header--watch a few seconds later as Ed ducks his head under it--and come to a stop mid-step as Ed pauses on the landing. When he starts up again, I hit the ground floor and pan right with him as my body counter-rotates back into Missionary, then I follow him to the door. We did dozens and dozens of takes with different focal lengths. Quite a night. The scene continues here, mostly with handheld and conventional shots, although there are a few Steadicam bits once Ed runs out to the street. Powerful scene!",
