The shot is long, and the action is merely conversation, however the writing maintains the attention of the viewer.  A shot like this may seem simple to shoot, however, due to the nature of the action, the camera must truly remain as \"invisible\" as possible.  This can only be done if the marks are hit and the lock-offs are performed perfectly.",
