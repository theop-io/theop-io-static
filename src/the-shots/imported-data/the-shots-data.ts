      "Fun stuff.  I think Tony was a bit more nervous than I was.  Of all the days you want your parents to watch TV, mine were on a  plane coming back from England.  Such is life.  I sent them a tape.  I had thought of spinning the rig 360 after I came out onstage but chickened out at the last minute.  Regretted it ever since.  Julliana Marguilies is sitting in the front row and you can hear her scream my name when Tony introduced me which I thought was cool.  Rich Davis came by set to do the behind the scenes stuff and did some great work.  Fun to have him flying around following me flying around.  Why was my hair blonde?",

It starts in Missionary pushing at Ed Norton, then I turn right to precede him down the stairs while panning left into Don Juan. I hit the landing (avoiding a light in the corner) and continue under an amazing low header--watch a few seconds later as Ed ducks his head under it--and come to a stop mid-step as Ed pauses on the landing. When he starts up again, I hit the ground floor and pan right with him as my body counter-rotates back into Missionary, then I follow him to the door. We did dozens and dozens of takes with different focal lengths. Quite a night. The scene continues here, mostly with handheld and conventional shots, although there are a few Steadicam bits once Ed runs out to the street. Powerful scene!",

There are elements of gunshots, animal cues, pyrotechnics, vehicles, special effects, and more that all had to both work perfectly and be timed perfectly.  ...not to mention the majority of the footing was sand.",
    operatorComments:
      "Taken from an email from Peter Robertson to Luis Puli.\r\n\r\nThe one-take Steadicam Dunkirk shot in Atonement may well prove to be the emblematic scene that the film will be remembered for. However, this was only one of a series of carefully crafted sequences that we, as a camera department with myself as the main camera operator, were asked to create in response to Joe Wright's powerful and uncompromising vision.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this was certainly the toughest shot to achieve, physically and logistically, coming in the last week of a long shoot and at the end of a day when we rehearsed many times with and without camera. The concentration levels needed to remember every beat, twist and turn of the shot, where to follow the actors movements, when to remember a step or obstacle whilst holding the shot composition compounded the physical demands of carrying a heavy camera.\r\n\r\nWhen Joe (Wright) and Seamus (McGarvey) first approached me with the idea of shooting the Dunkirk scene as a one-take Steadicam move I knew that it would take every ounce of my technical and physical Steadicam nouse from the past twenty years of operating to achieve. There would be no plan B to fall back on, with no wiping off and on the backs of background actors or objects to create edit points should a take prove imperfect.\r\n\r\nBorn partially out of financial necessity--I believe there was only enough money in the budget for 1,300 extras for one or two days--it was, nevertheless, a daring piece of filmmaking that challenged the gods. It was conceived to place the audience physically and emotionally inside the nightmarish vision of Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nThe scene tells the story of Robbie Turner played by James McAvoy attempting to return to his love Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) from the doomed beaches of Dunkirk. He is dying and engulfed by the living hell of one of World War II's most tragic episodes. It is essentially Robbie's nightmare that the camera describes, restlessly moving around a scene, sometimes bizarre (soldiers skinny dipping), sometimes macabre (cavalry horses being shot) and sometimes painfully moving (a choir singing on a bandstand). The uninterrupted flow of images drift in front of our eyes like a hallucination from a Bosch painting or, in the case of the dying horses, like the contorted images from Picasso's Guernica. The shot, unedited, has the power of a real nightmare with its bizarre associations. We sense that these events are all happening in the same physical space that we travel through as an engaged audience, not as a series of juxtaposed and montaged images that we view as outsiders. The camera not only shows the desperation and pain felt by the dying Robbie as he begins to realise that he may never see his love again but also the plight of a huge mass of stranded soldiers who desperately seek to return to their lives and loves. As such, the scene transcends the simple story of one individual's tale of lost love and evokes the sentiments of a great anti-war statement.\r\n\r\nTechnicalities\r\n\r\nWe shot Atonement on the Panavision system in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, using the Panaflex XL on the Steadicam with Primo lenses. However, the Dunkirk sequence itself posed many extra problems for us in the camera department. Whichever way the shot was timed on recces it always came to just under five minutes, ruling out the use of a conventional 400ft magazine. Our excellent 1st AC, Carlos de Carvahlo, pointed out that we could use a Panavision 500ft magazine, which had originally been produced for hand holding the earlier Panavision GII camera. Whilst heavier than a modern lightweight 400ft magazine, it was still preferable to a 1,000ft magazine, which was inconceivable on a shot like this. The extra 100ft gave us the time length we needed for the shot.\r\n\r\nFraming and composition posed a few problems too. The shot demanded a wider framing for the architecture of the set at certain times and a closer framing on faces that would loom into the lens at others. Again, we ignored convention and opted for the Panavision 17.5-34mm short zoom, which by remoting its function gave Seamus the option to zoom in shot. This lens gave us the optical range to see the set in all its glory without distorting the faces too much at close quarters. Seamus and I choreographed these zooms at moments in the shot when the natural movement of the Steadicam disguised them to the viewer's eye.\r\n\r\nThese decisions all had a bearing on the final configuration and weight of the Steadicam. By remoting all of the lens and camera functions it meant that I was carrying three motors (focus, iris and zoom) as well as the extra weight of the magazine. Add to this two video transmitters, one to the director's monitor and one to Seamus who needed a picture to gauge his zoom and iris pulls and you have an overall payload that weighed more than a standard airline baggage allowance.\r\n\r\nThe next problem was how to fly this around the beach with weightless elegance, covering close to quarter of a mile in the process and achieving the precision framing that the director demanded. It was not possible without a swift course of steroids and a metal spine implant to attempt the whole shot on foot. It was obvious that at certain times I would have to ride on a vehicle to cover the ground at speed and keep up with the action. I chose to ride a \"mule\" provided by Bickers Action Vehicles. This is a small open-backed vehicle with a rear-facing platform, much like a golf cart. A low step was rigged so that I could slide off the back when I needed to continue the shot on foot. I used this for the first part of the shot when the three main characters are striding along the beach past the horses being shot. The step off the \"mule' comes at the rear of the beached Thames barge, where a pause was built into the action to help disguise the step-off.\r\n\r\nThe shot continued, on foot, up the beach, onto the promenade and around the bandstand. After the bandstand I stepped down via a ramp, cunningly disguised by the art department as a pile of bomb debris and sat back onto a rickshaw rig, expertly gripped by Gary Hutchings and Dean Morris. This was then steered backwards through the chaotic scenes of soldiers riding a merry-go-round and disabling heavy artillery to the beginning of the pier. Here, with the help of a line of carefully placed soldiers filing past camera to once again disguise my step-off, I travelled, on foot, for the final part of the shot up some steps and past a line of soldiers to look back on the mayhem of Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nI hope this demonstrates how the whole shot was planned and executed like a military operation in itself and stands, as often these endeavours do, as a testament to the great teamwork it took to achieve. Forget Dunkirk, if I hadn't had the support of such a brilliant crew the sequence would have been the movie's Waterloo.\r\n\r\nMyth and Legend\r\n\r\nThe final take used in the movie was Take 3. We attempted a fourth but my timing was off and I missed my footing on the steps leading up to the bandstand. In a shot such as this, once the camera stops dead the shot is pretty much unusable. I realised, having given my all in the rehearsals (two of which were completed fully loaded with the camera) and three previous takes that I didn't have enough juice in the tank to complete a fifth. It felt like I had just performed a ten-hour gym session and, in hindsight, I consider myself lucky to have even completed three takes. Much has been publicised in print about how the Steadicam operator \"collapsed\" or even \"fell over\" which was claimed in some reports. All slightly melodramatic representations of what actually happened but I suppose that every movie needs its myth and legend.\r\n\r\nThe beach Steadicam team were:\r\nJoe Wright Director\r\nJosh Robertson 1st AD\r\nSeamus McGarvey, BSC Director of Photography\r\nPeter Robertson, GBCT Steadicam / A Camera Operator\r\nCarlos de Carvalho, GBCT A Camera 1st Assistant Camera\r\nJennie Paddon A Camera 2nd Assistant Camera\r\nRawdon Hayne B Camera 1st Assistant Camera\r\nIain Mackay B Camera 2nd Assistant Camera\r\nGary Hutchings, GBCT Key Grip\r\nDean Morris Grip\r\nChris Macaleese Camera Trainee\r\nSimon Thorpe Grip Trainee\r\nNick Kenealy Video Assist\r\nClive Bickers \"Mule\"",

Well, one look at this shot and I realized I had to tilt. In addition, the rig weighed so much with the BL and 7 pound Anamorphic that once we started down the stairs it just pulled me down. I had to begin to stop two steps before each mark and bounce down the last two steps on my heels to make it work without shaking the camera and to top it off we didn't have video transmitters at the time so David Lynch and Fred Elmes, ASC were running down the steps behind me looking over my shoulder. There was no room for a spotter. If I tripped it was four stories straight down. My focus puller, who ran down the steps with us,  was Lex Dupont who is now a DP and shot NYPD Blue. My second was Dave Rudd who is also a DP and shoots high end music videos and commercials.",

      "I fell on the very first take, due to the introduction of an ice sculpture that extras were wheeling in front of the camera for the first time on the take. Up until then they had rehearsed with an empty cart to save the ice from melting. The extra weight slowed them up considerably. I was following the actors into the underground garage and I had choreographed the ice sculpture to wipe through frame between the actors and me before after which I planned to race in front of the group in time to back through a narrow doorway. Unfortunately there was an army of people trailing me who had to then race around and precede me through that doorway (Brian, Vilmos, AD's, sound, my assistant, etc.) and there really wasn't enough time. Someone tripped my AC, Larry Huston, who graciously offered his body for me to fall on top of. I was completely unharmed, as was the rig, but Larry H. had a nasty gash in his head. He refused a ride to the hospital so we could continue to work, and the nurse reopened his wound after every take to keep it from healing improperly until he could get stitiches. What a trooper!! Brian, who is a master tactician and strategist just hadn't considered this possibility: he stood over me, and after seeing I was OK said \"I didn't think you could fall!\" He had anticipated every potential disaster but this one. We did another 11 takes until dawn when Vilmos informed me that this last take \"must be the one!!! The light at the beginning and end were perfect, and that WAS the one.\r\n\r\nEach take was a full 500' and the shot was over when the end of the film flapped through the gate.\r\n\r\nI wanted a device to let Bruce pass by me a little too close to the camera for focus in the elevator, and he came up with the idea of scooping up some Salmon Mousse, and twirling a little drunkenly past me. This also delayed the action enough for the rest of the crew (same group as before except for Larry H. and the boom woman with a wireless boom mike who rode with me) to exit the elevator next to us. They were timing their elevator to synchronize with ours on the way up to maintain a good RF link to the mixer. If the elevators rose side by side it worked fine, otherwise complete dropout. After exiting, I wanted to get back in front of Bruce so he came up with the Mousse Toss onto the wall thereby backing away from the camera enough to allow me to make a clean exit. There were many other devices like this throughout that I came up with to make the shot flow... I figure the more work everyone else does, and the less work I have to do, the better it will look...",

Not for its precision, or execution, but it's place in Steadicam history.  \r\n\r\n\"Bound for Glory\" is the first film to ever use the new tool.  At the time, the Steadicam was nothing more than a makeshift sled and vest, with a Luxo Lamp arm.  The shot, however, still has many of the key elements necessary to make a great shot even by today's standards.  This proves how much of great Steadicam operation is reliant upon the operator alone, not the equipment.",
    operatorComments:
      "--Excerpt from <i>The Steadicam Letter</i> March, 1989\r\n\r\nEarly in 1975, we were engaged to shoot on <i>Bound For Glory</i>. Haskell was DP and had persuaded the late Hal Ashby to try an extravagant time-consuming, expensive mega-shot with complete reliance on our contraption.  We had only one throated magazine.  I had never been on a feature set until I arrived in Stockton, CA and entered Ashby's enormous migrant worker camp with 900 extras.  Neither had I seen a Chapman Titan Crane in person, prior to being put up on the platform 30 feet in the air, hands shaking violently, with Don Thorin, the regular operator, who said, \"Look, that's funny, the camera isn't shaking!\"\r\n\r\nI got two rehearsals, and we broke for lunch, during which I had a beer and Don calmed me down a bit.  Then we made just three four-minute takes, (We had to run back to the darkroom for ten minutes in between each to reload the magazine).  As the crane boomed down beside David Caradine, I got off and \"walked\" with him across the huge camp and most of the way back, dodging kids and crowds and tent ropes and vehicles.  In the end, I was numb with fatigue and nerves, and the whole crew flowed away to resume the regular work without a backward glance.\r\n\r\nIt was two nights later (just after asking the producer if he was the projectionist!), that I finally saw our amazing shot and received a standing ovation (with real clapping and real standing!) from the large crowd in the screening room.  Amazing!  I stayed on the set for several more weeks and made a few nice shots, but the unit had progressed into night shooting and without a follow-focus system, it was clear that we weren't going to be of much use.",

      '<i>Quote from Carin-Anne Strohmaier, 1st Asst Film Editor</i>\r\n\r\nI\'m so glad so many liked this shot - this was one of Bob Z\'s favorite in the show. Having had to do the counts for this optical to Sony Pictures Imageworks (who deserve the credit for the final look) this was how it was done - a Steadicam person with the Vista Vision camera strapped to his chest ran backwards in front of Young Ellie as he goes up the stairs and down the hallway - there was a speed change - we ramp from 24 to 48fps (though I can\'t remember exactly - we could have ramped through three different speeds) - by the time she stops and puts her hand to open the medicine cabinet door ("A" plate ) - we are then inside the reflection. The medicine cabinet was the "B" plate (second plate) and then the door closes and we have the "C" plate (third plate) which was the reflection of the photo of Young Ellie and her dad. By the way - the first time we received this CGI shot as a final (completed & ready to be signed off) Bob Z noticed that the picture frame did not match the one in the Arecibo Puerto Rico bedroom with older Ellie and Joss so they had to have an insert crew reshoot the "C" plate with the correct picture frame and re-composite the shot over again - not an easy thing to do since timing was critical in getting everything to match up. I also liked to give our Avid assistant, Orlando Duenas, credit since he did the initial line up of the shots in our cutting room which Sony Imageworks used as a guide.',

      "Comments by Don Burgess, ASC\r\nPrinted in The ASC Magazine\r\nhttp://www.theasc.com/clubhouse/tricks/tip-db1.htm\r\n\r\nWe did a shot in Contact where we needed to tie in the actual location, the VLA in New Mexico, with our set at Culver Studios in Los Angeles. The shot starts just after Ellie (Jodie Foster) first hears the signal from outer space and races back to the main building in her car, slides to a stop, hops out and runs into the building.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this shot, Mark Ocaine, the Steadicam operator, stepped off a Titan crane and chased her into the building, down a hallway, around two turns and through a set of doors where this shot ends. Ultimately, a morph blend starts the second half of the shot, which we shot in Los Angeles at a later date.\r\n\r\nBecause the shot is a blend into another shot, we needed a larger negative to work with ‚Äî Vistavision being the choice. We used the small lightweight Beaumont Vistavision camera that fits on the Steadicam.\r\n\r\nThe sequence takes place just before the sun comes up so we decided to shoot the whole scene before sunrise and after sunset for the soft, cool light, which only gives you about twenty minutes at each end of the day. We rehearsed and rehearsed until the light was right and then shot until dark, having to change the lighting density on the inside of the VLA control room on every take to match the dropping exposure outside--all at a panic pace. Fortunately, Jodi and the Steadicam operator, Mark, were great on all five takes so we were able to choose the best shot of the five we exposed.",

    operatorComments:
      "The director of this movie, Eriq La Salle is a good friend of mine from my ER days and a big fan of cool steadicam shots to boot.  He brought me into the set, which was a common room in a boarding school, about three hours before the scene was to be shot and said \"This scene is the first time that we'll see how crazy this place is.  Design me a oner that shows me that with 3 things I've never seen before in it.\"  Now, I can't really say that I came up with three, but it's a fun shot and we came up with a gag where we hid stairs near the pool table and I got up on the pool table and walked across while following one of the pool balls.  The descent is not quite as seemeless as I would have liked it to be as the beach ball came a bit late but it was kind of cool nonetheless. The guy on the tricycle is the art director (maybe the props guy actually) as the extra we had on the trike was worried about riding into the wall and as th shot continues the guy has to hit the wall and crash.  Funny how these things works out.  I always liked the way it starts with the guy running out of the room too.\r\n\r\nThe second shot in the clip is the bus walk in.  One of those classic \"doh\" moments when you ask for something and something else shows up on the day.  They told me about this shot way ahead of time and I told them what kind of crane I needed, etc, and also told them that they needed to get a bus with as large an opening as possible.  When it showed, it had a 4 1/2 foot high door that was fairly wide.  I mentioned that I had told them the door had to be large and they said they thought I meant wide.  Now I'm 6'4 and weigh about 180 so you'd think that wouldn't be something that would need explaining.  So we started messing with it and found that if the crane came in low enough I could tip my head/torso/rig in just enough so that when I stepped forward, if the crane  started booming up and craning into the door, I could sort of pop in there.  We did a few unsuccessful runs until finally we got the timing right and while physics would seemingly dictate otherwise, we got the shot.  The bus didn't always hit it's mark quite right and as a result we had to compensate a bit.  As a result there is a fair amount more backpanning (and not too great at that) than i wish there were.  We worked out the flashes from the camera to go off as I entered the bus to try and hide that one moment where the speed of the shot changes.  It sort of worked but as I recall the flash never seemed to go off as much as we wanted.  Kind of fun to watch the making of as I hadn't seen it in a while.",

    operatorComments:
      "The concept was 3 individual single shot videos playing at the same time in a 1.85 frame. So each was in a .62 narrow frame. We shot all frames centered and then in post the frame was repositioned as needed. Each shot followed one of the artists in their own apartments/storylines. All 3 come together near the end of the video so timing was critical so it appeared that the action matched.\r\n\r\nWe shot the video in a two story apartment building with a large interior lobby that ran the length of the building. The first apartment was in the back on the 1st floor, the third was in the front on the 1st floor, and the 2nd was in the front on the 2nd floor.\r\n\r\nIt was shot over 2 days plus a short scout day. On the scout day the director walked me thru the first shot which was described as the most difficult. It started in the back apartment had many hard cues we had to hit. It moved out into the lobby, down a flight of stairs, back up the stairs, into the apt, out and to the front of the lobby, back to the back of the building and outside, back inside and into the apt, out and to the front of the lobby and into the third apt. Well, I reminded the director that we only had a 4 min video and didn‚Äôt think that we could make it. We ended up dropping the down stairs portion.\r\n\r\nShoot day. Beyonce was in the 1st apartment. She worked with us for hours before she went to hair/makeup. She was one of the most professional performers I have worked with and really wanted to get it right. We worked with a stand-in to coordinate all the crap that had to happen behind the scenes. \r\n\r\nMy assistant had his hands full for all the shots. We flew 2 Prestons. The 1st AC was pulling focus and iris and was next to camera as normal. He was on headset to the 2nd AC that had focus distances written down and was calling out focus marks, because much of the pulling was done blind due to physical constraints of the apartment. The 1st had to dodge electrics with chimeras that came in and out as well as me and Beyonce making some fast moves. (with the .62 frame, it was OK to have people in the outside .62 on either side of the 1.85 frame). The other Preston was zoom and was operated by the DP watching a monitor from an upstairs apartment. He also had cues and was making the size changes, of which there were many.\r\n\r\nIt was many years ago but I think we did 20-30 walk thrus, 10-20 full-ish rehearsals and 12-16 takes. It must have been hard for Beyonce because I was on headset with the director giving her direction from him during the shot, such as to slow down, speed up, relax etc., as well as time cues and yelling cues to others, of course all this was over the loud playback. Lots of people had cues to get out of the way!\r\n\r\nWe finished the first shot about 2p-3p. The crew and I were exhausted. Then we found out we were going to try to get the next shot as well. . . THAT DAY.\r\n\r\nThe next shot started in the upstairs apt, moved out into the upstairs lobby, down the stairs out the lobby to a taxi, back inside, up the stairs in the apt living room, into the kitchen, out of the apt down the stairs AGAIN, into the lobby and into the 3rd apt. And we need to get this by sunset. . .in about 4 hours. As you can see by the video, the best take for me was not used in the final cut.\r\n\r\nThe major obstacles for me were getting down the stairs. The building was built in the 20s or 30s and the staircase was very narrow and had a turn in the middle. The steps on the inside of the turn were 1‚Äù-2‚Äù wide so I could only walk on the outside. Time for some creative arm movement. Also the ceiling above the stairs was about 6.5‚Äù and had a drop down sprinkler pipe running along it, so booming up was out of the question. Also the director wanted a two shot of them walking down the stairs together. . .IN A .62 FRAME! And the best part was the last 5 steps at the bottom were higher then all the previous steps. I basically ended up falling down the last 5 steps just to keep up. I couldn‚Äôt have a spotter because there was just no room and I was running down the stairs with my assistant. I think he might have had a spotter.\r\n\r\nWe get outside only to have the sun blasting right at the front of the building. You can really see the iris pull. I hate the flare. And you can see the camera shadow on her. I remember that I tried to get them to break up the shot so we could avoid the shadow, but that‚Äôs not what the director wanted.\r\n\r\nTiming, timing, timing. Being the 2nd shot now realized how critical the timing was at the end when the girls came together. I think we only did about 3-4 full rehearsals and 14 takes. I limited my rehearsals because of the stair work. I spent a lot of time, without the rig, on the stairs figuring out were I would be and in what position. Also, where all the other behind the scenes players would be. Lots of people hiding. Again the DP was making zoom changes with the 2nd Preston and the 2nd AC was calling out focus cues over headset to the 1st AC while watching a monitor.\r\n\r\nI should say that the grips and electrics on this job were outstanding. I have worked with them on and off for years. They seem to enjoy their work, which is rare these days, and I can rely on them to back me up. We all accommodate and respect each other‚Äôs positions.\r\n\r\nShoot day 2 was much easier than the first. We shot the third performance in the lower front apt and hall. It was slower movement but confined spaces. I think the crew and I were exhausted from day one and liked the slower pace.\r\n\r\nI was mostly happy with the work at the end of the shoot. I really thought we had a good concept and product. But, after seeing the video I think the video doesn‚Äôt work. There is too much happening in frame and the viewer can‚Äôt understand all the storylines. In post they did adjust the .62 to enlarge at certain points to emphasize individual frames.\r\n\r\nI have worked for this production company occasionally over the years and they are one of the best. The producer even gave me a generous bonus at the end because the whole video was steadicam and worked out so well.\r\n\r\nA funny little story. The three apartments used were repainted for the shoot the day before the scout. On the scout day it was decided that the colors were not what was desired and all three apartments were repainted overnight. Then after the shoot, the apartments were again painted with what ever color the tenants desired. Three different paint jobs in one week!",

From a technical point of view the tough part was that we were doing all of the speed changes in camera with a huge honkin' cable attached.  Made the whip pans oh so much fun.  Norman Parker was my assistant on that show (although he would definitely tell you that i was his op not the other way around) and as we went though the shot, he had to anticipate the moments and speed change accordingly.

I convinced the gaggle of background gals that I would only take 20 minutes of their lunch to shoot their section, and somehow we knocked out a good 15 or so setups in that time. While I am proud to be a multi-hyphenate behind the scenes, adding "actor" into the mix on top of it all was a stretch but it all came together in the end.\r\n\r\nThe little clip from 1985 was from workshop section of the well-known National Geographic documentary, which I think can be seen on Garrett\'s site.

      'One of the best known Steadicam one-shots.  We track Liotta and his date as they enter the nightclub through the back entrance.  Tracking through the hallways, kitchen, and eventually the crowd, this shot contains excellent examples of how "dead space" in a shot can creatively be filled.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTaken from <i>American Cinematographer</i>: Oct 2003\r\n\r\nSays McConkey, "Several times I would get to a moment when I felt the shot was starting to die, so we\'d bring in another character for Ray to interact with." As the shot reaches its climax in the club\'s main room, a table is set up for the couple near the stage. Writing about this shot, Brown notes that in the hands of Scorsese, Ballhaus and McConkey, the Steadicam became a very different instrument than the one used on The Shining. In the Goodfellas sequence, he says, the device is "disarming and cheerful and entirely about the careless power of Ray Liotta and his mobster pals." McConkey says, "I deliberately tried to take on the role of an audience member and behave as a surrogate character that responds on their behalf. I thought of myself as a tour guide driving a bus, a sports car or a boat, gently leading the audience to anticipate a turn or surprising them with a sudden curve."',

      'Watch this shot a few times.  Notice how the operator seems to be thinking one step ahead of the action at all times.  Starting with a crane step-off, this shot is not terribly long, but contains a number of very specific cues, each one of which the operator lines up and hits every time.  A very interesting cue to observe is as the actress rounds the police car, she is frame left with the paramedics previewed in the background, frame right.  In an instant, the camera moves around, setting the paramedics as the focus of the frame having swapped sides with the actress.  A similar "frame-swap" happens a moment earlier with the fellow in the police car.',
    operatorComments:
      "To soften the step-off, I requested a foreground cross which resulted in the gal with the flashlight (who kept missing her cue--this time she materialized early), followed by a fast roundy-round with the boom up with Charlize in the middle of it, which was a challenge. Once I got to the front I was then supposed to let her pass me which felt a little stagnant, so I designed the little move where she cut around the metal pole to the outside and I went to the inside, resulting in a sort of interesting loopedy-loop effect (if you watch the pole). This led into a series of countering moves where I slid Charlize to one side of the frame and the other. She helps out by taking looks this way and that. I had also suggested that the coroners pull the gurney out in between us to add some dynamic. They had a hard time getting the wheels down in time and I would come perilously close to scraping the rig against the trailing edge. The kitchen inside was so tight that I had to do the initial lateral move by sliding the rig across my body as I took the one or two possible steps, not an ideal way to perform such a shot. And to let Charlize pass me, I had to slide back but of the way and then fold in behind her. Lots to do in a small space. We did a lot of takes of this one, it was a cold and windy night. I was amazed at how little light we were shooting in outside. Roger Deakins always keeps me guessing.",

      "This shot is probably one of the most well known shots of recent years.  Without first hand commentary from those directly involved, how this shot was executed would probably still baffle even other veteran operators.  Impressing your peers is always the greatest reward.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSource: <i>The Observer</i>, 9/22/02\r\n\r\nThe production's turning point, most agreed, came on the fourth day - an ambitious Steadicam shot in which the camera needed to snake its way through the bustling nightclub, following The Bride down a flight of stairs, around a corner, then rising up and over a wall to follow her (as though looking straight down from the ceiling) into a bathroom, then back down on the ground, out into the club, across the stage where a band was performing, over a dance floor and up a stairwell on the other side of the room. \r\n\r\n'I remember when they described it to me I said, \"What was that part about going over a wall?\"' says Larry McConkey, a veteran Steadicam operator, laughing. \r\n\r\nIn the end they had to shoot the bustling nightclub, and then, when the camera turned, remove one of the side walls and roll in a crane that McConkey could climb aboard which then transported him over the wall and into the bathroom. As he shot in there, the crane was rolled out, the wall replaced and the bustling resumed before the camera made its way back. \r\n\r\n'I got bounced around pretty good,' McConkey said. 'I never actually hit the ground, but I hit just about everything else.' The intricately choreographed scene required 17 takes, Walsh said, but they got it in one day.

The shot continues, following Hugh Grant up the steps into "No. 10" and then down another couple of steps and further into the extensive interior set.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a couple of funny things to note, both of which happen after my website version ends. Firstly, if you look closely you can just tell that for some reason Hugh\'s tie was changed between our Steadicam shot and the close up. Secondly, you can notice a certain instability in the frame on the cut back to the Steadicam shot just before Hugh walks off. The boom op. had managed to get his cable wrapped around the battery on my sled and the rest of the shot was done with, shall we say, a rather firm grip around the post!',

Well I must admit it was a difficult shot and I was a young operator at the time. I see things that I would do differently today. Sad news is the director of that film , Marc Rocco died recently. It was his inspiration and imagination that helped form that shot. We rehearsed the shot in sections about 10 times, then we just started burning takes. I think we did about 10 takes, I think that the final shot is number 8. I just remember being very tired after each take. I believe that was shot on a Panavision lightweight (Lightweight my butt.)I beleive the lens is a 27mm. This was 1994 gang, I'm trying to remember as much as possible. The bars were breakaway and slid back into place as I cleared them. No CGI here. Those were the good old days. My favorite part of the shot is simulating the fake elevator stopping. (felt like I was making my own quiet, unapproved contribution to the shot.)",

Just returned from Nepal on gig for the last month (no steadi just operating...thank god!). I gaurantee I got it everytime. We shot over 3 days and had 1 16hr day that we actually got it the first time but the band was absolutely wiped off. They looked like they were about as thrilled as getting a root canal thru the whole thing. The second time we got it was one they used, not my best though due to damn machine. I almost got killed by Donkey Kong barrel after ping pong balls because of box being in barrel track (PA not quick enough to grab so he left it...thanks, I had to kick out of way.) Then by oil drum at end of shot that popped up different then the other 85 times we tried it. Just about took out my legs and I almost missed the end!!!!! Could you imagine missing the end after all that. The third time we got it the TV didn\'t blow and the bowling ball just missed it\'s target so Dan (band memeber) kicked the trigger for hammers and what not at the end. I\'m actually emailing producer to see why I\'m the fall guy:-( "Camera guy didn\'t get it"...come on man! Damian Kulsah is a great guy and creative genuis behind all you see here. We got it three times, band got it twice, machine got it twice but camera got it thirce baby!\r\n\r\nIt was shot with the Sony EX-3. The band owns the camera. Of course you could hardly see it under the all the "extras" (FIZ unit, Cinetape, Cam wave, etc...). Needed the extra weight though, camera is just a bit too light even with Anton Bauer brick slapped on the back.',

      '--Excerpt from <i>The Steadicam Letter</i> - March, 1989\r\n\r\nShooting <i>Rocky</i> in Philadelphia was a great experience.  The non-union crew worked out of one beat-up motor home.  Sly Stallone was a sweet, unpretentious guy, and the "traps" and "delts" of his ego had yet to be pumped up, so the work was a pleasure.  Ralf Bode was DP, and John himself operated most of the conventional camera setups.  My only problem was keeping the camera running in the cold.  The two CP batteries weren\'t strong enough, particularly after a dent in the center-post started rubbing against the internal motor shaft.  We made the well known Art-Museum Steps shots with Ralf running along beside me carrying two automobile batteries to jump-start the Arri!',

      'I showed up on thet set not knowing anything about this video. It turns out that the only game plan was to turn this gal loose in a four walled set and chase her around with the Steadicam entirely unrehearsed and "see what happens". I suggested to the director that it might be more interesting to actually design a series of shots with some visual tricks and transitions, and he pretty much sat the rest of the day out while we did just that.\r\n\r\nWe fashioned a "slavecam" setup out of bits of lumber found on the stage, and 6 crewmembers hoisted me up for the section that looks down on her. Normally you should have 8 people lifting you, so it was a little dicey getting up and down quickly! Having the camera flash wasn\'t my idea--it\'s been done and done again as a cut point and often you can tell the actor is not in the same place after the cut. There is a cut in the 360 degree whip pan when she hits me with the pillow, that one worked pretty well.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be cool if after she appears to grab the mattebox and spin me around, the camera would look "woozy" and stagger away from her. Turns out this just looks like bad operating. Well, what good are music videos if you can\'t experiment.\r\n\r\nSomewhere during the strobe light sequence, our chanteuse got woozy herself and nearly passed out. Supposedly she hadn\'t eaten anything that day, or maybe had been partying the night before. In any event, we nearly shut down because she couldn\'t get off the sofa. Eventually, we got through the final segment of the video, but her energy is noticeably off from the beginning. Too bad as I recall that we had some fun stuff planned. At one point she is coming towards camera and I actually had to take my hand off the post and point to the direction she needed to go next, which she dutifully followed.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the morning I was thinking this could be my big contribution to the particular ouevre of Steadicam in music videos.

From her morning routine as the camera passes through her bathroom window (mid-mode / sled length was critical - see pics) - putting on deodorant (the product) - running through the apartment late for work, checking her mail, running outside, petting the neighbors dogs, missing her bus, hanging out with friends, getting her hair done, running through a rain shower, meeting her boyfriend at a night club, then taking him home where we find her still smelling great after her hectic day.\r\n\r\nCommercials can seem frivolous like that, but the concept was great. No cuts, no artificial effects (which reflected the quality of the product), just pure choreography, whip pans, timing and creativity. It took 1 month to build the set. 1 week to rehearse and 5 days of shooting to get 1x60 second shot, 1x30 second shot and 2x10 second shots.\r\n\r\nThe commercial was shot during the day although half of it takes place at night. The grips built a massive tent that was over 3 stories high to accomodate lighting, rain towers, cars and a bus, a 27 foot crane on 50 ft of track etc. The tent was pitched so that rain (Vancouver in Autumn) could run off - plastic skin over massive blacks covering a whole city block.\r\n\r\nWe used twins so that as we whip panned from one scene to the next we would find the same lady apparently at a different time of day, although only a second later in reality. When we whip panned out of the apartment into the hallway of the building to find her checking her mail, the 1st sister had to sprint through a secret door we built into the wall and jump down a 15 ft slide where new wardrobe was waiting for her, quick change, then come out of the revolving doors of an office building. It was better than Batman & Robin!! We re-discover her outside after the other sister meanwhile has just missed her bus.\r\n\r\nAlso another note on sled configuration. You will notice that I had a 3 battery set up (2x Dionic 90's & 1x Proformer) This served two purposes beyond giving me a long run time. Both reasons were dictated by the opening element of the shot that started outside the bathroom window and traveled through it to take a good look at the product which is put there by the actress as we start the move toward the window.\r\n1. The mass of 3 batteries helped me to keep the sled down to appropriate length to get through the window in mid mode.\r\n2. Kept the gimbal far enough away from the camera that I could make fast switches back and forth between lo mode and hi mode without worrying about clearing the camera. Remember that keeping the monitor and all positionable mass (Preston) also helps to achieve this.\r\n3. Because the 3 battery was mounted out in front of the sled bottom, it meant that I could bring the whole AR cage back a little on the top stage in order to accomodate other clearance needs of getting through the limited space of the window.\r\n- So, balance, gimbal position and sled length played a big part in achieving the first difficult part of the shot (and the most important part, the product shot).\r\n\r\nWe also finessed a lot of the shot via wireless control of the Iris and the Zoom. We used the 15-40mm Angenieux zoom lens of the 235 and obviously had a wide range of lighting to control as we went from inside to outside and day into night. The AC did a fantastic job of controlling focus and the iris pulls on the Preston hand unit.\r\n\r\nThen I gave the separate Iris/Focus unit to the DP and clamped it to his handheld 7inch monitor, so that he could watch the shot and zoom in and out appropriately. Originally I had given him the wireless microforce zoom control, but this proved to be too slow at times and not fast enough at others. We attached a zoom stick to the focus knob of the Iris/Focus unit and this gave him the ability to snap zoom when needed, like during a whip pan, and yet do a very slow creep at other times. That took a day to work out!",

    operatorComments:
      "-<i>Written by Rob Van Gelder, 11/26/05</i>\r\n\r\nThis was done in an abandoned buiding site, the whole structure, with the stairs was like this. Of course it was all dressed as it was supposed to be an exclusive nightclub.\r\n\r\nAll the stunts are real, the main actor is incredible, like elastic and can do every asian fighting style. The guy that is thrown out from the second floor fell on a air cushion that was wheeled in after the guy from the first floor was thrown in the little temple down the hall. This was a major operation, the cushion, around 8x8 meters and 2 meters high -had to be wheeled out again for the final top-shot at the 3rd floor.\r\n\r\nWhen I did the rehearsal, I tried to be closer to him, which resulted in one stuntman that crashed right into my rig (bent monitor support) halfway the shot, but i managed to go on till the end. However, I was not able to do it within the 4 minutes for the full roll.....  Mind you, it was high summer and about 36-38 Celsius and no airconditioning in his building!\r\n\r\nThe shot was done on an Arri3, with the 10mm zeiss. What you see here is the TV version, it was widescreen to begin with. In widescreen it would be frequently too wide, in my opinion, but for TV it holds really well.\r\n\r\nThe second try-out with my colleague Somsak took one day of rehearsing again and the next day they shot it-- in 1 take !!!!\r\n\r\nAmazing!",

      "This shot is an excellent demonstration of the Steadicam becoming simply an extension of the operator's body.  When the action is running at such a pace, as well as changing direction as many times as it does, anything but a 100% connection between operator and rig would lead to hesitations and imperfections that would clearly be seen in the shot.  While any shot, regardless of pace, should be executed instinctually rather than reactively, this shot clearly demonstrates the importance of it.  If the operator were to think about each move related to each action, the action would quickly get ahead of the camera, and the shot would fail.  \r\n\r\nMuscle memory is one of the most important skills for an operator to develop.  As we maneuver our bodies around our environments every day, even without looking, we're aware of where our feet, hands, knees, shoulders, etc are.  We're generally aware of where the objects in our environment are relative to those parts, and we instinctually know how to move each part around the objects, avoiding collision.  With enough time wearing the Steadicam, the operator will develop the same sense about the rig - knowing where it starts, where it ends, and what is around it, enabling them to move smoothly through the environment.  ***The set designer would probably be displeased if a large heavy Steadicam had run into the glass table with the tall glass vases on it!",
    operatorComments:
      "Coming in to do the double-up units on \"Ugly Betty\", I always admired Rick Davidson's work on the main unit particularly the long and fast walk and talks through the Mode magazine office set. They looked like fun but we never seemed to do those on the other unit. Then this shot materialized. After seeing the dailies, Rick expressed his jealousy that I got to do this (although I could swear I'd seen him do more elaborate shots than this many times--the grass is always greener, along with the monitor)!\r\n\r\nMy least favorite part comes up right away, the gent carrying the boxes that causes the gals to swerve camera left. In previous takes there was more of him in the shot so you could see what they were avoiding; for some reason it didn't happen this time. The director had inserted this business in there to extend the walk as the dialogue was too long for the length of travel in this section.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the seemingly never-ending nightmare of composing for dual formats is well-represented here; had I been allowed to compose solely for 16:9 I would not have played the two so wide, but I had to fit them into 4:3 leaving tons of room on the sides. When will this madness end?\r\n\r\nWhen the handoff occurs from one character to the other I had to scuttle nimbly around the light table; as Afton indicates this was one of those instinctive muscle-memory moments (can flab also have a memory, by the way? Mine certainly seems to) wherein by the latter takes I didn't have to take my eye off the monitor to know that I was clearing the table at high speed. Giving chase to the actors on the other side required a fancy little series of arcs that are of course gruesome with Steadicam, as the inertia wants the rig to kick out one way then the other (I do detect a bit of roll as I flatten into the straight-away heading to the reception desk). Because of the wide lenses used on this show, it's a bit unrelenting when it comes to horizon; the distortion coupled with the rounded doorways sometimes makes things look off-level even when they aren't!\r\n\r\nAs the Amanda character drives Betty backwards into their marks, I asked her to land in a 50-50 to maximize her face time and then counter right as I crossed behind her to clear America (Betty). Once she got the hang of it it worked pretty seamlessly.\r\n\r\nComing around the reception desk to re-meet America is an interesting moment--normally this \"trombone\"  would have a fairly obvious change of direction, but because of the round walls somehow the transition is softened and it is difficult to detect just when I had to come to a stop and kick into reverse. I asked America to counter to camera left as she broke away from the other actress to clear her and then counter back to clear the gent entering from the other side. Fortunately America is very savvy to this sort of thing and never questions it.\r\n\r\nThe shot continued for another thirty seconds or so but it cut away to coverage in between. I think we did about 16 takes, maybe half of which were complete from beginning to end.",

    operatorComments:
      "I really like the way this shot worked out and still enjoy watching it. There was a lot of anticipation for this shot considering the limited amount of time for the actual execution and the unprecedented permission to block so much traffic to do it. We heard that Tom had a personal meeting with the mayor to help convince the city of the value of doing so. John Toll rightly felt that as much rehearsal and anticipation of problems as we could perform in the week before shooting it, the more likely we would be successful on the day. There was a limit on how long the city would let us lock everything up even on an early Sunday morning when much of NYC would be slow getting up. Several times we rehearsed with Steadicam and Crane including a mockup of an unmoveable guardrail that we had to work the crane arm around. Tom participated in these rehearsals as well so we shared a clear understanding of what my limitations and requirements would be. John wanted a low angle for the beginning of the shot which moves towards the car as it approaches the camera. This suggested using low mode, but I was hesitant to try the difficult transition to the crane with that added difficulty. I wanted to be as comfortable as possible in the mode I was most experienced with. Instead, I rigged my rickshaw in the lowest position possible for high mode and working with the grips came up with a foot rest that barely scrapped the ground until the moment I wanted to get up and off it as Tom got out of the car. Placing my weight on the footrest immediately dug it into the pavement gently catapulting me out of the seat and continuing the shot with as little perturbance as I could manage. Meanwhile the crane crew swung the arm into position as I slowly rotated around Tom so I could back right onto it without hesitation. These transitions are the hardest part of stepping on or off vehicles or other conveyances and I try to design shots so the transitions are a continuation of the direction the shot is moving, instead of interrupting the flow. In this case, the crane arm was ready to swing back and up in the same direction that I was already moving and Tom timed his run to accelerate only after I was safely on the crane and on the way up. I rehearsed the transitions out of the rickshaw and onto the crane endlessly with a lot of help from the grips to make it a simple a process for me as we could. I never try to be a \"hero\"in situations like this: operating Steadicam is difficult enough without having to navigate around obstacles unnecessarily as it has been made abundantly clear to me in the past that any effort I make operating the Steadicam will be in the shot for all to see. If the shot is not supposed to be about the operators effort, there should be as little effort operating as possible. The grips built a circular ramp leading up to the crane platform that could be quickly re-oriented in any direction in case of a last minute change in the shot design. There was as much wind protection as we could rig around me and I used gyros on the shot as well. Any wind will ruin what otherwise might be a flawless shot so I am adamant that I must be protected as carefully as possible. I can't remember exactly what version of a seat I used on this shot as I have evolved the way I ride cranes over the years, but the current setup I use is a gas shock bazooka letting me adjust the height to exactly where I want it, mounted on a flat cheese plate that can be bolted down wherever I need it on the platform which presents only a half inch thickness for me to deal with. It holds a 3 way leveller head on which is mounted a seat I modified from a tractor supply design. It has arm rests on the side that I lowered and widened a bit to provide a kind of 'V' shape to guide me into position if I back into it a little off line, and provides some lateral support after landing. It is positioned just slightly lower than standing height with a bit of down angle to the seat so I end up half sitting, half leaning back into the seat. The bazooka tube gives me lots of room underneath for my feet with little obstruction. I have put lots of effort into these kinds of details to make it as easy as possible for me to execute the shot. Again, the easier the shot is to execute, the better it will look on screen! Once we got a few good takes I was able to relax a little and look around from my position high above Broadway. It was very eerie to see no one but Tom below me! The rest of the scene was intercuts between Steadicam mounted on Herb Ault's extraordinary electric car and a camera car with arm and remote head for the very tight, more jittery looking shots as Tom ran very, very, very fast. The last shot, twirling around Tom, could have been done in low mode also, but John supported me in building a raised round platform that Tom could stand on as I ran around it in high mode. Part of the reasoning was that we didn't want to take time to convert the Steadicam but again because I would be more comfortable in that mode and get the shot more quickly and perhaps with more control.",

    operatorComments:
      "Commentary by Dave Chameides, alternate operator\r\n\r\nThe way this shot came about is a bit of an oddity.  I was sitting at home when the phone rang and an AC named Steve Peterson said he was calling to see if i would come out as a sort of insurance policy on a show they were doing.  He explained that Greg Bubb was the op and that they were doing a huge shot that involved stairs and had 100's of extras, etc. etc.  Production was concerned that if greg accidentally hurt his ankle on the stairs they'd be screwed so they wanted me to come out and basically sit around at full rate.  While this sounded like the dream job (getting paid for doing nothing and getting to hang around watching how another op operates doesn't seem too bad right) I told him I'd be happy to do it, but Greg had to call me and tell me it was all cool first.  Sure enough, the phone rang 5 minutes later and Greg told me it was all on the up and up and that I should come in and most likely would end up doing nothing and go home. I got to set just before lunch and was able to walk through a \"finger rehearsal\" with Greg once before they broke us.  Over lunch I (I think I had the salmon) I asked Greg what he wanted me to do and he said I should just kick back and keep an eye on the monitor as four eyes are always better than two.  So over the next few hours, I watched while Greg completed about 14 or so takes, nailing, as I recall, at least 5 or 6 of them.  He's a great op and it was a pleasure to watch him work.  At the end of the 14th or so take, he was really wiped and said he needed a break (I was actually shocked that he hadn't asked for one earlier as I was sweating just watching!).  I assumed that that was that and that I'd be heading home as they had already printed several takes when the director pointed in my direction and said \"We're paying him right, why doesn't he do it\".  \r\n\r\nAfter I was informed that there would be no rehearsals and I should just give it a shot, I went to build my rig.  Greg came over to talk to me and clue me in on a few things he had learned thus far and I asked him what i should do because to most of the people there I was doing the shot for the first time, but as Greg already knew, I had done it 14 times in my mind, watching him improve every time, so now it was just down to the physical side of things.  He told me to go for it and i did a few takes and they sent me home. Whether this is my take or Gregs, I honestly couldn't tell you, but I also don't really think it matters.  We both did the shot and we both did it well.  As Greg has pointed out in another forum, while either of us could be credited with the shot, it should also be noted that Key Grip Gary Dagg and his amazing crew kept us up and moving the whole time guiding us as they went, Gaffer Bobby Krattinger and his crew hid all the lights to make it all possible, Steve Peterson kept everything in focus, and on and on.  It takes an entire crew to pull off a shot like that and Greg and I just happened to be the lucky (or unluckky depending on what you're into) ops who got the opportunity. As for the shot itself, Greg had the foresight to lay board on the stairs at the top so that helped with getting up the stairs.  A bridesmaid with a poofy dress helped to hide them at one point as I recall.  I backed up the stairs as I hate Don Jaun (the operating position, not the man) and the rest was just finding the frames etc.",

      "As operator 2 of 7 on the first season of West Wing (!), shots of this length and complexity were a daily occurence. Hats off to Don Thorin Jr. and Chad Persons who both spent years flying up and down these hallowed halls!\r\n\r\nThe roundy-round at the beginning required very specific timing to get certain lines delivered on-camera--you can see Rob Lowe \"helping\" clear himself twice. Once off and running through the lobby, it's a dodging match of Xmas trees, 'xtras and, uh, xylophones (?) until we get into the relative peace of the final hallway.\r\n\r\nOn a number of occasions such as this one I had to fly the rig sideways through doorways; although the doors were built slightly oversized from standard, this still left just a few inches on either side of mattebox and mag. With the rig in front of me I would take my best shot and close my eyes as we passed the threshold, hoping we wouldn't clip off any expensive Panabits!",

    operatorComments:
      'Physically this is probably the most demanding shot I have ever tried.  I think we rehearsed it twice without the rig and once with, although I may have just suggested we go for it now that i think of it.  We did something like sixteen takes over about 5 hours and I think this shot is take 12 as I remember.\r\n\r\nAbout a week before this happened, the EP Tommy Schlamme came down to set and said that Sorkin was thinking of writing this huge shot but they weren\'t sure if it could be done.  So the next night after filming, we all headed down to the Biltmore Hotel in downtown LA and walked through it.  I must have been a bit out of it because i distinctly remember saying "Sure, it shouldn\'t be a problem".  In retrospect perhaps I was medicated.\r\n\r\nThe shot actually starts a moment or two before the clip with a quick lock off.  As I pulled them around the corner and started down the stairs it was actually easier than it looked.  The stairs are a bit steep but basically there\'s only one way to go (down) and one place to point (down) so it was just sort of "keep following them" at that point.  \r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the stairs was the first hurdle as I had to get in front of Brad and Allison without seeing myself in the glass on the freezer.  I worked out the little arm grab thing with Allison so that they would slow down and I could use their bodies to hide the reflection.  As I recall this was one of the few takes where the timing was off so if you look close you can see me in there. The next hurdle was leaving them and moving forward to Moira and Rob, so we used the device of the secret service guy busting through to push me back.  I kept on pulling back to grab Richard, at which point a big flame from the cook was supposed to go off, but again, timing was off and it didn\'t happen.  Bets laid plans right?\r\n\r\nAnd then came the dreaded second steps.  We had built a ramp on one side for me to go down and my least favorite part of the shot happens there as everyhting sort of traffic jams while I start down.  I rarely actually found the ramp and just sort fo bullied my way down the stairs.  When we had walked through the shot the week before, they had explained that this was where I would pick up Martin and bring him down and the only concern was could I get down the stairs.  I told them I could do it, but had they said "And see Martin behind the two huge secret service agents who are in front of him" I might have said otherwise.\r\n\r\nI backed down the stairs as I am not a fan of Don Juan (but thoroughly enjoy a good windmill mind you) and basically just laid back down on the two grips who were behind me making sure i didn\'t fall.  Incidentally, other than the assistant, I was alone until I made the turn around after the first stairs where the grips and a boom op fell in step with us.\r\n\r\nThat final walk down the hall and turn to meet the cars was probably the easiest technically but the hardest physically as my body was pretty wrecked after all the stairs.  There is a little bit of sloppy framing that i\'m not too psyched about but it was all I could do to keep going.  There is a moment just before I go to the side angle at the end where you can hear Martin say "ahhhh", which is because he screwed up the line, but they picked it up and went with it and put the correct line in his mouth in post.  On take 10 which was truly the best, I hit the rig with my knee at that point, blowing the shot, and seriously almost cried I was so depressed.\r\n\r\nThe end of the shot, which actually lasts a few seconds longer than the clip here, was a lock off to head to credits that was so tough that you can actually hear me grunting on dailies.  My back hurts just thinking about it.',

We leave the bathroom with the character; tub empty, bathroom clean and dry.  We enter the bedroom, and then the hall which contains an alternate door to the bathroom.  In under 60 seconds, the crew had completely changed the dressing of the bathroom.  Not only is it now completely fogged up, but the bathtub is full of water - still water, to be exact.  A couple of CG effects help to sell the ghost's presence.  The foley department did a great job in post of recreating the natural sounds since the noises the crew made in the background had to be cut out.",

Very heavy I must say. There is quite a lot of Steadicam in Wild At Heart including the famous scene in the now extinct Palamino night club where Nicolas Cage says, \"This is a Snake Skin jacket. It's a symbol of my indiviuality and personal freedom.\" All in all a great film and a wonderful experience.",

The primary place edits took place in this shot were the elevator.  Since it was a sound stage, the elevator did not actually move.  Each time characters needed to change floors, the set needed to be redressed.  \r\n\r\nContrary to that point was one sequence of floor changes in which the sets were changed as they shot.

      'This was a fun, challenging and very exhausting episode that shot for approx. 10 days. We were shooting 12 to 14 hr. a day with the steadicam and by day three I seriously had my doubts that I could hold up for the duration of the shoot, but after that day the fatigue factor seemed to level off.\r\n \r\nGetting in the VW van was a big challenge. Tommy Doherty the key grip built a wooden bench inside the van with a very slick surface for me to sit on. The plan was for me to sit down and then slide across into the car. The problem was, as soon as I took one foot off the ground my momentum would completely stop. To get the shot my Assistant Trevor Loomois had to stop pulling focus at the point of entering the car and literally push me into the van, then he would jump in. Yes it was very tight and I did have to bend a little and lower my head to enter. On the first take the actor who was driving popped the clutch which sent me flying right at Gillian Anderson, I stopped myself by extending my left arm ( I operate"goofy") and grabbing the seat back behind her. Initially I was very worried because a few days prior to shooting this part of the sequence I confidently stated ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to get into the van‚Äù.',
