  // For this hack, we're selecting anchors that contain a child span with an explicit inline style
  // calling for a strike-through (`line-through`) which is what the SquareSpace editor generates, i.e.:
  //
  // - an interior span, it doesn't decorate the <a> itself
  // - an interior span with an inline `style=""` attribute
  //
  // Because the CSS attribute selector is a direct text match and not a regular expression,
  // we have to specify this twice:
  //
  // - once without a space in the middle of the `style` attribute (what SquareSpace generates)
  // - once with a space in the middle of the `style` attribute (which is what our VSCode-formatted test code defines)
  //
  // This hack is obviously on the fragile side, it's just (probably) the better choice compared to doing this in JavaScript.
  //
  // Note that we're selecting for spans inside an <a> so that non-anchor text can still get normal strike-throughs.
