Skate Wheels = Two rows of skateboard wheels placed at 90 degrees to each other used under the wheels of a dolly. Skateboard wheels make it much easier and smoother to push a dolly on track.
Oner = When an entire scene is played in a single shot. A oner with coverage is a oner that they then decide to do coverage on after the fact.
Master = Usually the first wide shot of a scene that sees the entire story and all the players. The average master will generally run the entire scene and coverage will be determines off it it as well as things like the line.
Remote Head = A two (pan/tilt) or three (pan/tilt/roll) axis head that is remotely controlled by either wheels or a joystick. These can generally be found on the end of a crane allowing the operator to operate a shot where they can’t get near the camera, but they can also be on a dolly, on a ladder, or anywhere that a camera could be put where the operator can’t easily access it.
Practical = Something that is real and not fake or a prop. A practical location is an actual location - a diner, a drug store, a restaurant - as opposed to a set. A practical when talking about a light is a light that exists in the world of the movie and is being used for lighting but can be seen on camera. “The actor will then turn off the practical before she gets into bed.”

Put it on its feet = Actually starting to put the scene together as it will finally be seen. This is usually done after the actors read the words on set for the first time. “OK, now that we've read it through once, let's move around the room and put it on it’s feet”
Turning Around = Having shot in one direction you are now going to “turn around” to shoot in the opposite direction. Usually called out so that people know that equipment will have to be moved.
Solid = A piece of solid duvatene that light cannot pass through in a frame used to block out light from a scene or take care of lens flare.
Flop/Floppy = A 4x4 solid that has another 4x4 piece of black fabric that is attached on one edge and held in place by velcro on the opposite edge. Once in place, the “flop” part of the solid can be pulled down to either make a right angle or turn the 4x4 into a 4x8.
Apple Box = A wooden rectangular in various sizes used for all sorts of things from standing on to raising things up. Sizes are as follows: Pancake - 12x20x1, Quarter - 12x20x2, Half - 12x20x4, Full 12x20x8. Apple boxes are called from by name and asking for a complement means bring one of everything. “Not sure what we will need so bring me 2 pancakes, a half and a full and we will see if that works.”
Cup Blocks = A 6”x6”x2” piece of wood with a slight bowl carved out of the top of it. Cup blocks are used to raise things and since they have the indented bowl, furniture legs will sit in them and not slide off. They can easily be stacked to make things higher.
Wedge = A 12” wooden 2x4 cut on a diagonal so the one end of it is thin and it gradually increases to the far end. Camera wedges are much smaller versions of this.
Camera Wedge = A small wooden, plastic or metal wedge used to shim up and level a camera when it is on a surface such as the floor or a sandbag.
Dolly Track = Metal dolly track that is generally straight and interlocking. The dolly is placed on top of it with special wheels and can ride on the rails like a train. Dolly track can be as long as 100 feet or more but without specialty equipment can only go straight. There are rare occasions where curved track is used but it's not usually done.
Precision Track = Dolly track that has been machined to extreme tolerances so there are no bumps between the seams in the tracks.
Boards/Planks = Flat long pieces of wood, usually 1 foot wide, that can quickly be thrown down to achieve a smooth dolly shot. Usually come in 12 or 16'.
Dance Floor = Flat sheets of wood and plastic, usually 4'x8' that are built on uneven floor so that the dolly can be moved around smoothly but not in a straight line as if on track.
Dolly Party = When four or more grips get together to carry a dolly up or down an area where it can't roll. “Let's get a dolly party over here to get this thing up those stairs.”

Reconnoiter = Sadly a word used completely incorrectly in the film industry to mean to move something. “Lets reconnoiter this couch over there so we can get the camera in place”. In reality reconnoiter means to scout out ahead of time and gather information. Use this term incorrectly around Simon Jarvis and he will lose his mind.

Sand Bag = A heavy bag used to secure stands and such from falling over. Can be used for a million different things and often can make the difference in a shot.
Shoe Leather = Unnecessary movement to cover space that is usually deemed worthy of cutting out. A person gets out of a car and has a long walk to the building to meet the protagonist and there is no value in the walk itself to build any drama. ‘We could continue the shot to the front door but it seems like a lot of shoe leather so let him out of frame quickly and we will pick it up at the front steps’.
Rolling Reset = The scene (props, cameras, lighting cues, etc) will be reset while the cameras are rolling rather than cutting the cameras, resetting everything, and starting again.
Shot Bag = "A small bag filled with actual metal gun shot, usually ten pounds."
Ball Buster = "A large sand bag, usually 35 pounds."
Skoche = "A small amount. “Move that lamp over just a skoche for me.”"
Clicks = Denotes time period on a timecard. Most shows break the hour into 6 minute intervals so each hour has 10 intervals or ten clicks. “I put two clicks on your time card because parking is so far away from set.”
Tailights = The absolute time a crew has to be at a location. This doesn't mean stopping shooting at that time, it means tail lights are leaving the location. “We are tailights at this location at midnight so we will probably have to finish shooting by 11 to allow the crew to wrap in time.”
Going Again = "Shooting an additional take. “We got that and we are going again.”"
If it Aint It Aint = Slang term used to let everyone know that the present shot is the last shot of the day or at that location and anything not working can be packed away for the night/move to next location. “We have one more take of this shot and it's the last scene here so if it aint it aint.”
Walk Away = Quite literally, drop what you are doing and leave the vicinity. “We have to get this in the next 5 minutes so if you aren't involved in this shot, walk away.”
Bogie = Used to describe someone you aren't supposed to see in the frame, generally during a lockup. “We should cut because I've got two bogies across the street pointing at us and taking pictures.”
Martini = Last shot of the day. 'We are on the martini so anything that’s not working can head to the trucks.'.
Upstage/Downstage = Upstage is away from camera, downstage is towards camera. Easy way to remember it is theater. Down stage is towards the audience and upstage is away from the audience.
Hot points = Verbal cue that something large that can hurt you is being brought onto set. Generally called out by electricians or grips who will often have to carry long pieces of equipment on their shoulders. When 'hot points' is called out, be extra aware.
Lockup = When an area is being controlled and no outsiders are allowed in. Generally used when working on location and quite often having to do with traffic control. 'We are locked up' means that PAs are stationed in the appropriate areas to stop people not involved in the scene from wandering on camera. 'Breaking a lockup' means someone has sneaked thorugh.

Crafty = Also known as Craft Services. A table, truck, area that is set up for snacks and drinks to be grabbed on the go by the crew during the day.
On the day = When you actually shoot whatever is being discussed. 'Right now there is a mirror on the wall but on the day there will be a poster hanging there'
Hot Set = A set that should not be touched, usually for continuity purposes but sometimes because it has been set up with special effects that can’t be disturbed. Signs and/or police tape are generally used to denote a hot set. 'Everyone should know this is now a hot set and no one should be on it except props and special effects.'
Standing by = Someone or something is ready adn waiting. 'Let’s have the flowers standing by for the next scene', 'Second team is standing by and ready to step in once the ladders are out.'
Flying in = Also 'coming in hot'. Announced on set so someone realizes that the thing that was requested is on it’s way.
Coverage = After the wide shot of the entire scene has been shot (generally called the Master shot), coverage is up next. This is where the camera generally gets closer to the actors and moves in as close as they choose to in one direction, and then generally does the same shots as a reverse on the other actor (if we are talking about two actors with classic coverage of a scene).
Back to one = Usually called out when a shot needs to be stopped and restarted from the beginning (or on a rolling reset). Back to one means everyone, camera, actors, etc, should go back to the positions they started in and props should be reset to the beginning of the shot.
Tapeball = Literally a wadded up ball of tape usually used to angle out a glass picture frame or a glass cabinet that is throwing a bad reflection. 'Can someone tapeball the bottom left corner of that picture frame to get rid of the reflection of the light stand?'
Follow Focus = A device the 1st AC uses to change the focus on a lens during the scene.
Low Mode = Usually refers to dolly or steadicam, when the camera is mounted lower/at the bottom so that it can get closer to the ground. On a dolly it often means dropping donw the front section os it doesn’t get as high but can get lower. On a steadicam, the rig is inverted and the camera hangs underneath.
High Mode = Usually refers to dolly or steadicam. When the camera is mounted in such a way that it can get higher but not as low. Also known as normal mode.
Riser = A metal piece that is used on a dolly to get the camera higher, which literally raises the camera. Can be used on sticks as well or anything that accepts a head and has a Mitchell mount. Usually comes in 3”, 6”, and 12” pieces
Bowling Trophy = A large, usually 3 foot riser used for extremely high shots. Its name is derived from the fact that it looks like a trophy someone would hold over their head.
Day Playing = Coming in for just a day or two on a show rather than working for the run of the show. 'I'm day playing around right now but hoping to land something long term soon.' A day player is the term for someone who dayplays.
Wheels of Death = Pizza, generally brought in for second meal and eaten while standing, most often over a garbage can at 2 in the morning. As an Op, yours will always be cold.
Over/Over The Shoulder = Short for over the shoulder (OTS). A shot from behind one actor, across their shoulder, to another actor who is speaking to them.
The Line = An imaginary line that is drawn between two actors in a scene. Once the blocking has been determined, the camera should generally only shoot from that side of the line and not cross it. 
Offset = A device that can be put on a dolly to allow the camera to sit somewhere other than the center of the boom arm. Offsets are used to move over things, under things, or just to gain a few inches left or right of center and be able the line things up correctly.
Key Grip - Head of the grip department. The Key Grip is generally on set all the time (with the exception being when they may scout a location ahead of time and will appoint a grip to be key for the day) is the person in charge of the grip department and generally in charge of all rigging, building, etc.
Best Boy - There are two best boys, grips and electricians, and they generally do not spend a lot of time on set. They are tasked with making sure their departments have everything they need for the days coming up, any special projects, and keeping all repairs in order so that everyone has everything they need to get things done on the day.
Sides (Bigs/Small) = Printed pages of the day's script that have a small version of the call sheet on the front. It’s basically a program for the day's activities and as an op you can read the scene again during rehearsal and use it to recall a line cue. Most shows have smalls (smaller versions that easily fit into a pocket) and bigs (8x11 size for those who can’t read the small stuff). It's a huge waste of paper so I have a big pile of them at home that I use for note paper over time and there is still no explanation why small sides can't be printed to fill the whole page with the call sheet.
Honeywagon = Mobile bathrooms on location
2 banger/4 Banger/6 Banger = Location bathrooms that come in 2, 4, or 6 stall sizes
Ring it out = Leaving set to pee. “Cover me while I ring it out.”
Hit the head = Going to the bathroom. “Cover me while I hit the head.”
Cover me = Making sure someone's absence isnt felt when they have to step off set. When an operator has to leave for a minute they may ask the 1st AC to “cover me” or “keep an eye” in case someone needs the camera moved or a new element changes in the shot.
First team = The actors in the scene. “Let’s work out the details of the move with first team since they will likely do it differently.”
Second Team = Also known as “stand ins” second teamers will take the actors marks and re-enact their movements for camera and lighting before first team comes back in.
Video Village = Usually a bunch of seats in front of a monitor or two where the director, scripty, and sometimes the producers or writer will sit.
PA = Production assistant. They are the bottom of the food chain and an entry level position but know this - they are why we are able to do what we do because they do everything from getting actors to set to locking up traffic to grabbing food to making sure everyone on set knows what is happening next. This industry couldn’t exist without them adn some day you will work for many of them, so be nice.

Marking Rehearsal = After a private rehearsal a marking rehearsal with the actors is generally called for. As the actors move around the room, a 2nd AC will drop tape marks on the floor (or physical marks if outside) to denote where the actors stop. This allows the second team to recreate what the actors are doing when the crew is lighting.
Private Rehearsal = Usually the first rehearsal which involves the director and the actors. Many times the DP and the script supervisor will be included as well as the camera ops. The intensity of the scene will usually determine if a private rehearsal is necessary or not as the actors and directors need time without everyone watching to work out the dramatic beats of a scene. A "priavte private" means no one but the director and the actors.
Clear the set = Called out, usually prior to a private rehearsal, when everyone is asked to leave the set for a few minutes. Can also be called out when there is a hazard.
Going hot = When special effects are used - squibs, sparks, explosions - this is generally the last step and is called out when the fx team hooks up the final wires to make the effect “live”. Everything should be in place and ready to go when the announcement that they are going hot is made.

Coming in hot = Coming in quickly. Usually denotes a driver coming to a quick stop or some sort of moving vehicle coming in fast. “Make sure you have enough room to pull out of the way because the driver will be coming in hot.”
Call sheet = Emailed or hand delivered at the end of the day, the call sheet lists the next days work, location, call times, special equipment and a myriad other information. Safety bulletins involving the days work should also be attached. Around lunchtime a preliminary call sheet will generally come out which gives people a heads up as to what is coming donw the pike for the next day. Reading call sheets is extremely important in order to avoid surprises. At the bottom of most call sheets is a glimpse at the next two days as well and on the back is everyone's call times.
Call time = The time that you are expected to arrive on set. Be aware that there is crew call (the time listed on the front top of the call sheet in large numbers) and your call time (which may differ and is listed on the back of the call sheet by department and name).
Pre-Call = Time before the crew call given to certain crew members so they can prepare gear/load in, etc before the day starts. Pre-Call is on the time card and affects your lunch and out times as well as turn around.
Greens = Crew member who is in charge of anything related to trees, shrubbery, nature in general, usually used to dress or hide things in an outside location. A lot of times you will simply call them by both their name and title. “Can someone ask Bob Greens to come over and help me cover up this area of the wall with a shrub?”
Mayonnaise Commercial = What you tell lookie loos walking by you are shooting so they become disinterested and walk on by.
Lookie Loos = Individuals standing and watching what you are shooting.
Props/Property = Props are any items that are actually used in the scene by an actor. Property is the name of the department who is in charge of all props. “Let property come in and grab these props before we start moving things so they don't get lost”.

Dead soldier = Anything that is no longer useful but generally used to mean a dead battery.
Butt Dolly = A single seat on a riser with wheels, usually five or more, that is used for an operator to sit on and shoot handheld. The five or more wheels means that they can seamlessly move in any direction without having to first get the wheels straight.
Blocking = The art of figuring out where people will stand in a scene, how they will move, and what they will do. Good blocking can make a scene and make the way to shoot it seem effortless while bad blocking/no blocking can destroy the best written scene in the world.
DP/DOP/Director of Photography = The head of the camera, grip, and lighting department, the DP is the person who is in charge of the look of the show, the framing, the lighting, and anything visually oriented.
Boom = When used in the world of the dolly, the boom replies to vertically moving the camera through space using the (generally) hydraulic arm of the dolly. The dolly grip can boom the camera up and boom the camera down. When used in the world of sound, the boom is actually short for boom pole, a long pole the boom operator will use to hold a microphone over a scene.

Flying in = Used to explain that something is coming to set. “Tell someone to grab the viewfinder off the cart and let me know when it is flying in.”
ND = Neutral Density. A filter, sometimes in front of the lens and sometimes behind, that will stop light from hitting the sensor of the camera. ND filters generally come in sets of 3 (3,6,9) and each number means 1 more stop of light is detracted from the scene. A good quality ND will not change the image in any way beyond changing the amount of light that comes thorugh the lens and hits the sensor.
Pickle = The control on a telescoping arm the makes the crane/camera extend towards the subject or retract from the subject. There is usually one person who is “on the pickle” and deciding when and how to move the camera in that plane. Operators will often say “pickle in” or “pickle out” but since in and out can actually mean different things to different people many prefer to use extend and retract.
Dailies = A compendium (now usually online sadly) of the days filming that can be viewed. Dailies used to be projected every morning before work (sometimes after as well) and most people would show up to see them. As an operator or an assistant it was a fun but jaw clenching experience.
One Liner = Comes out ahead of a production and usually new versions appear throughout production as things change. A one liner will have each days work listed with info on timing, scenes, page count and potentially location.
In the movie = Meaning something that will actually be on the screen.
NIM = Not in the movie, means it will likely never make the final cut.

Headroom = The room in the frame that starts at the top of the head and ends at the top of the frame - so the space above the actor. Large headroom means an unnaturally large amount of space above the actor. Tight headroom means leaving less than would normally be seen.

Nights = Working from dusk till dawn. “Crap, we are working nights all next week.”

Splits = Working mid morning until mid evening so starting at around 10 AM and working until 10 PM. A heavy/deep split is considered starting around 2 or 3 and working until 2 or 3 in the morning. “We are working a deep split at the end of the week so I’ll be able to get to the doctors Friday morning.”
Magic Hour/Tragic Hour= The time between sunset and dark that often has the best light for exterior shots. Magic hour is sometimes also referred to as tragic hour because companies will wait until just the right moment to shoot and then only have about 20 minutes or so of remaining light so everyone goes nuts.

On the truck = Literally residing on the truck. When a piece of equipment is available but not on set it is “on the truck” and needs to be sent for.
Hiatus = The down time when a show is not shooting but is coming back at some point. Usually refers to a tv show, which will be on hiatus in between seasons but can also happen in film, when a break is being taken for a season change, actor availability, or some other reason.
6th day = Most schedules shoot 5 days a week but the 6th day can happen as well as the dreaded 7th. As these days often cost much more it happens rarely and is a grueling thing for a crew to have to endure.
2nd meal = The first meal that is broken for during the day is lunch, regardless of what time of the day it is eaten and usually comes 6 hours into the day. 6 hours later, if you are still shooting, a second meal can be offered as well, either with or without a break.
Walking meal = A meal that is offered when, usually for timing reasons based on light or location, a break is not offered. Walking meals are generally handed out and eaten while the crew continues to work adn are considered on the clock.
